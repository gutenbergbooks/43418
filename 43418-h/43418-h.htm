<h2><a name="SECRETS_OF_THE_LIQUOR_TRADE" id="SECRETS_OF_THE_LIQUOR_TRADE">SECRETS OF THE LIQUOR TRADE.</a></h2>

<p><em>Cider Without Apples.</em>&mdash;To each gallon of cold water, put 1 lb.
common sugar, &frac12; oz. tartaric acid, 1 tablespoonful of yeast, shake
well, make in the evening, and it will be fit for use next day. I
make in a keg a few gallons at a time, leaving a few quarts to
make into next time; not using yeast again until the keg needs
rinsing. If it gets a little sour make a little more into it, or put
as much water with it as there is cider, and put it with the vinegar.
If it is desired to bottle this cider by manufacturers of small
drinks, you will proceed as follows: Put in a barrel 5 gallons hot
water, 30 lbs. brown sugar, &frac34; lb. tartaric acid, 25 gallons cold
water, 3 pints of hop or brewers' yeast worked into paste with &frac34; lb.
flour, and 1 pint water will be required in making this paste, put
altogether in a barrel, which it will fill, and let it work 24 hours&mdash;the
yeast running out at the bung all the time, by putting in a little
occasionally to keep it full. Then bottle, putting in 2 or 3
broken raisins to each bottle, and it will nearly equal Champagne.</p>

<p><em>Cider Champagne, No. 1.</em>&mdash;Good cider, 20 gallons; spirits, 1 gallon;
honey or sugar, 6 lbs. Mix, and let them rest for a fortnight;
then fine with skimmed milk, 1 quart. This, put up in champagne
bottles, silvered and labeled, has often been sold for Champagne.
It opens very sparkling.</p>

<p><em>Cider&mdash;To Keep Sweet.</em>&mdash;1st. By putting into the barrel before
the cider has begun to work, about half a pint of whole fresh mustard
seed tied up in a coarse muslin bag. 2d. By burning a little
sulphur or sulphur match in the barrel previous to putting in the
cider. 3d. By the use of &frac34; of an ounce of the bi-sulphite of lime
to the barrel. This article is the preserving powder sold at rather
a high price by various firms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>

<em>To Neutralize Whiskey to make various Liquors.</em>&mdash;To 40 gallons of
whiskey, add 1&frac12; lbs. unslacked lime; &frac34; lb. alum, and &frac12; pint of
spirits of nitre. Stand 24 hours and draw it off.</p>

<p><em>Madeira Wine.</em>&mdash;To 40 gallons prepared cider, add, &frac14; lb. tartaric
acid; 4 gallons spirits; 3 lbs. loaf sugar. Let it stand 10 days,
draw it off carefully; fine it down, and again rack it into another
cask.</p>

<p><em>Sherry Wine.</em>&mdash;To 40 gallons prepared cider, add, 2 gallons spirits;
3 lbs. of raisins; 6 gallons good sherry, and &frac12; ounce oil bitter
almonds, (dissolved in alcohol). Let it stand 10 days, and
draw it off carefully; fine it down and again rack it into another
cask.</p>

<p><em>Port Wine.</em>&mdash;To 40 gallons prepared cider, add, 6 gallons good
port wine; 10 quarts wild grapes, (clusters); &frac12; lb. bruised rhatany
root; 3 oz. tincture of kino; 3 lbs. loaf sugar; 2 gallons spirits.
Let this stand ten days; color if too light, with tincture of rhatany,
then rack it off and fine it. This should be repeated until the
color is perfect and the liquid clear.</p>

<p><em>To correct a bad Taste and sourness in Wine.</em>&mdash;Put in a bag the root
of wild horse-radish cut in bits. Let it down in the wine, and
leave it there two days; take this out, and put another, repeating
the same till the wine is perfectly restored. Or fill a bag with
wheat; it will have the same effect.</p>

<p><em>To restore Flat Wine.</em>&mdash;Add four or five pounds of sugar, honey, or
bruised raisins, to every hundred gallons, and bung close. A little
spirits may also be added.</p>

<p><em>To restore Wine that has turned sour or sharp.</em>&mdash;Fill a bag with leek-seed,
or of leaves or twisters of vine, and put either of them to infuse
in the cask.</p>

<p><em>Ginger Wine.</em>&mdash;Take one quart of 95 per cent. alcohol, and put
into it one ounce of best ginger root (bruised and not ground), five
grains of capsicum, and one drachm of tartaric acid. Let stand
one week and filter. Now add one gallon of water, in which one
pound of crushed sugar has been boiled. Mix when cold. To
make the color, boil &frac12; ounce of cochineal, &frac34; ounce of cream tartar,
&frac12; ounce of saleratus, and &frac12; ounce alum in a pint of water till you
get a bright red color.</p>

<p><em>French Brandy.</em>&mdash;Pure spirits, 1 gallon; best French brandy, or
any kind you wish to imitate, 1 quart; loaf sugar, 2 ounces; sweet
spirits of nitre, &frac12; ounce; a few drops of tincture of catechu, or oak
bark, to roughen the taste if desired, and color to suit.</p>

<p><em>Gin.</em>&mdash;Take 100 gallons of clean, rectified spirits; add, after you
have killed the oils well, 1&frac12; ounces of the oil of English juniper, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>&frac12;
ounce of angelica essence, &frac12; ounce of the oil bitter almonds, &frac12;
ounce of the oil of coriander, and &frac12; ounce of the oil of caraway;
put this into the rectified spirit and well rummage it up; this is
what the rectifiers call strong gin.</p>

<p>To make this <em>up</em>, as it is called by the trade, add 45 pounds of
loaf-sugar, dissolved; then rummage the whole well up together
with 4 ounces of roche alum. For finings there may be added two
ounces of salts of tartar.</p>

<p><em>Aromatic Schiedam Schnapps, to imitate.</em>&mdash;To 25 gallons good common
gin, 5 over proof, add 15 pints strained honey; 2 gallons
clear water; 5 pints white-sugar syrup; 5 pints spirit of nutmegs
mixed with the nitric ether; 5 pints orange-flower water; 7 quarts
pure water; 1 ounce acetic ether; 8 drops of oil of wintergreen,
dissolved with the acetic ether. Mix all the ingredients well; if
necessary, fine with alum and salt of tartar.</p>

<p><em>St. Croix Rum.</em>&mdash;To 40 gallons p. or n. spirits, add 2 gallons St.
Croix Rum; 2 oz. acetic acid; 1&frac12; ounce butyric acid; 3 pounds
loaf sugar.</p>

<p><em>Pine-Apple Rum.</em>&mdash;To 50 gallons rum, made by the fruit method,
add 25 pine-apples sliced, and 8 pounds white sugar. Let it stand
two weeks before drawing off.</p>

<p><em>Irish or Scotch Whiskey.</em>&mdash;To 40 gallons proof spirits, add 60 drops
of creosote, dissolved in 1 quart of alcohol; 2 oz. acetic acid; 1
pound loaf sugar. Stand 48 hours.</p>

<p><em>Rum Shrub.</em>&mdash;Tartaric acid, 5 pounds; pale sugar, 100 pounds;
oil lemon, 4 drs.; oil orange, 4 drs.; put them into a large cask
(80 gallons), and add water, 10 gallons. Rummage till the acid
and sugar are dissolved, then add rum (proof), 20 gallons; water
to make up 55 gallons in all; coloring one quart or more. Fine
with 12 eggs. The addition of 12 sliced oranges will improve the
flavor.</p>

<p><em>Bourbon Whiskey.</em>&mdash;To 100 gallons pure proof spirit, add 4 ounces
pear oil; 2 ounces pelargonif ether; 13 drs. oil of wintergreen, dissolved
in the ether; 1 gallon wine vinegar. Color with burnt
sugar.</p>

<p><em>Strong Beer, English Improved.</em>&mdash;Malt, 1 peck; coarse brown sugar,
6 pounds; hops, 4 ounces; good yeast, 1 teacup; if you have
not malt, take a little over 1 peck of barley, (twice the amount of
oats will do, but are not as good,) and put it into an oven after the
bread is drawn, or into a stove oven, and steam the moisture
from them. Grind coarsely. Now pour upon the ground malt 3&frac12;
gallons of water at 170 or 172° of heat. The tub in which you
scald the malt should have a false bottom, 2 or 3 inches from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
real bottom; the false bottom should be bored full of gimlet holes,
so as to act as a strainer, to keep back the malt meal. When the
water is poured on, stir them well, and let it stand 3 hours, and
draw off by a faucet; put in 7 gallons more of water at 180 to 182°;
stir it well, and let it stand 2 hours, and draw it off. Then put on
a gallon or two of cold water, stir it well, and draw it off; you
should have about 5 or 6 gallons. Put the 6 pounds of coarse
brown sugar in an equal amount of water; mix with the wort, and
boil 1&frac12; to 2 hours with the hops; you should have eight gallons
when boiled; when cooled to 80° put in the yeast, and let it work 18
to 20 hours, covered with a sack; use sound iron hooped kegs or
porter bottles, bung or cork tight, and in two weeks it will be
good sound beer, and will keep a long time; and for persons of a
weak habit of body, and especially females, 1 glass of this with
their meals is far better than tea or coffee, or all the ardent spirits
in the universe. If more malt is used, not exceeding &frac12; a bushel,
the beer, of course, would have more spirit, but this strength is
sufficient for the use of families or invalids.</p>

<p><em>Root Beer.</em>&mdash;For 10 gallons beer, take 3 pounds common burdock
root, or 1 ounce essence of sassafras; &frac12; pound good hops; 1 pint
corn, roasted brown. Boil the whole in 6 gallons pure water until
the strength of the materials is obtained; strain while hot into a
keg, adding enough cold water to make 10 gallons. When nearly
cold, add clean molasses or syrup until palatable,&mdash;not sickishly
sweet. Add also as much fresh yeast as will raise a batch of 8
loaves of bread. Place the keg in a cellar or other cool place, and
in 48 hours you will have a keg of first-rate sparkling root beer.</p>

<p><em>Superior Ginger Beer.</em>&mdash;Ten pounds of sugar; 9 ounces of lemon
juice; &frac12; a pound of honey; 11 ounces of bruised ginger root; 9
gallons of water; 3 pints of yeast. Boil the ginger half an hour
in a gallon of water; then add the rest of the water and the other
ingredients, and strain it when cold. Add the white of an egg,
beaten, and &frac12; an ounce of essence of lemon. Let it stand 4 days,
then bottle, and it will keep many months.</p>

<p><em>Spruce Beer.</em>&mdash;Take of the essence of spruce half a pint; bruised
pimento and ginger, of each four ounces; water, three gallons.
Boil five or ten minutes, then strain and add 11 gallons of warm
water, a pint of yeast, and six pints of molasses. Allow the mixture
to ferment for 24 hours.</p>

<p><em>To Cure Ropy Beer.</em>&mdash;Put a handful or two of flour, and the same
quantity of hops, with a little powdered alum, into the beer and
rummage it well.</p>

<p><em>To give Beer the appearance of Age.</em>&mdash;Add a few handfuls of pickled
cucumbers and Seville oranges, both chopped up. This is said to
make malt liquor appear six months older than it really is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>

<em>How to make Mead.</em>&mdash;The following is a good receipt for Mead:&mdash;On
twenty pounds of honey pour five gallons of boiling water; boil,
and remove the scum as it rises; add one ounce of best hops, and
boil for ten minutes; then put the liquor into a tub to cool; when
all but cold add a little yeast, spread upon a slice of toasted bread;
let it stand in a warm room. When fermentation is set up, put the
mixture into a cask, and fill up from time to time as the yeast runs
out of the bunghole; when the fermentation is finished, bung it
down, leaving a peg-hole which can afterwards be closed, and in
less than a year it will be fit to bottle.</p>

<p><em>Stomach Bitters, equal to Hostetter's, for one-fourth its cost.</em>&mdash;European
Gentian root, 1&frac12; ounce; orange peel, 2&frac12; ounces; cinnamon,
&frac14; ounce; aniseseed, &frac12; ounce; coriander seed, &frac12; ounce; cardamon
seed, &#8539; ounce; unground Peruvian bark, &frac12; ounce; gum kino, &frac14;
ounce; bruise all these articles, and put them into the best alcohol,
1 pint; let it stand a week and pour off the clear tincture:
then boil the dregs a few minutes in 1 quart of water, strain, and
press out all the strength; now dissolve loaf sugar, 1 pound, in the
hot liquid, adding 3 quarts cold water, and mix with spirit tincture
first poured off, or you can add these, and let it stand on the
dregs if preferred.</p>

<p><em>Soda Syrup, with or without Fountains.</em>&mdash;The common or more
watery syrups are made by using loaf or crushed sugar, 8 pounds;
pure water, 1 gallon, gum arabic, 2 ounces, mix in a brass or copper
kettle; boil until the gum is dissolved, then skim and strain
through white flannel, after which add tartaric acid, 5&frac12; oz., dissolved
in hot water; to flavor, use extract of lemon, orange, rose,
pine-apple, peach, sarsaparilla, strawberry, etc., &frac12; ounce to each
bottle, or to your taste.</p>

<p><em>Bead for Liquor.</em>&mdash;The best bead is the orange-flower water bead,
(oil of neroli,) 1 drop to each gallon of brandy. <em>Another method</em>:&mdash;To
every 40 drops of sulpuric acid, add 60 drops purest sweet oil
in a glass vessel; use immediately. This quantity is generally
sufficient for 10 gallons spirit. <em>Another</em>:&mdash;take 1 ounce of the
purest oil sweet almonds; 1 ounce of sulphuric acid; put them in
a stone mortar, add, by <em>degrees</em>, 2 ounces white lump sugar, rubbing
it well with the pestle till it becomes a paste; then add small
quantities of spirits of wine till it comes into a liquid. This quantity
is sufficient for 100 gallons. The first is strongly recommended
as the best.</p>

<p><em>Coloring for Liquors.</em>&mdash;Take 2 pounds crushed or lump sugar, put
it into a kettle that will hold 4 to 6 quarts, with &frac12; tumbler of water.
Boil it until it is <em>black</em>, then take it off and cool with water, stirring
it as you put in the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>

<em>Wax Putty for Leaky Casks, Bungs, etc.</em>&mdash;Spirits turpentine, 2
pounds; tallow, 4 pounds; solid turpentine, 12 pounds. Melt the
wax and solid turpentine together over a slow fire, then add the
tallow. When melted, remove far from the fire, then stir the
spirits turpentine, and let it cool.</p>

<p><em>Cement for the Mouths of Corked Bottles.</em>&mdash;Melt together &frac14; of a pound
of rosin, a couple of ounces of beeswax. When it froths stir it
with a tallow candle. As soon as it melts, dip the mouths of the
corked bottles into it. This is an excellent thing to exclude the
air from such things as are injured by being exposed to it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<hr class="line" />
<h2><a name="DRUGGISTS_DEPARTMENT" id="DRUGGISTS_DEPARTMENT">DRUGGISTS' DEPARTMENT.</a></h2>

<p><em>Arnica Liniment.</em>&mdash;Add to one pint of sweet oil, two tablespoonfuls
of tincture of arnica; or the leaves may be heated in the oil
over a slow fire. Good for wounds, stiff joints, rheumatic, and all
injuries.</p>

<p><em>Ayer's Cherry Pectoral.</em>&mdash;Take four grains of acetate of morphia,
2 fluid drachms of tincture of bloodroot, 7 fluid drachms each of
antimonial wine and wine of ipecacuanha, and 3 fluid ounces of
syrup of wild cherry. Mix.</p>

<p><em>Balm Gilead.</em>&mdash;Balm-gilead buds, bottled up in new rum, are very
healing to fresh cuts or wounds. No family should be without a
bottle.</p>

<p><em>Blackberry Cordial.</em>&mdash;To one quart of blackberry juice, add one
pound of white sugar, one tablespoonful of cloves, one of allspice,
one of cinnamon, and one of nutmeg. Boil all together fifteen
minutes; add a wineglass of whiskey, brandy or rum. Bottle
while hot, cork tight, and seal. This is almost a specific in diarrhea.
One dose, which is a wineglassful for an adult&mdash;half that
quantity for a child&mdash;will often cure diarrhea. It can be taken
three or four times a day if the case is severe.</p>

<p><em>Brandreth's Pills.</em>&mdash;Take two pounds of aloes, one pound of gamboge,
four ounces of extract of colocynth, half a pound of castile
soap, two fluid drachms of oil of peppermint, and one fluid drachm
of cinnamon. Mix, and form into pills.</p>

<p><em>Brown's Bronchial Troches.</em>&mdash;Take one pound of pulverized extract
of licorice, one and a half pounds of pulverized sugar, four
ounces of pulverized cubebs, four ounces of pulverized gum arabic,
and one ounce of pulverized extract of conium. Mix.</p>

<p><em>Bryan's Pulmonic Wafers for Coughs, Colds, Etc.</em>&mdash;Take white sugar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
seven pounds; tincture of syrup of ipecac, four ounces: antimonial
wine, two ounces; morphine, ten grains; dissolved in a
tablespoonful of water, with ten or fifteen drops sulphuric acid;
tincture of bloodroot, one ounce; syrup of tolu, two ounces; add
these to the sugar, and mix the whole mass as confectioners do
for lozenges, and cut into lozenges the ordinary size. Use from six
to twelve of these in twenty-four hours. They sell at a great
profit.</p>

<p><em>Candied Lemon or Peppermint, for Colds.</em>&mdash;Boil one and a half
pounds of sugar in a half pint of water, till it begins to candy
round the sides; put in eight drops of essence; pour it upon buttered
paper, and cut it with a knife.</p>

<p><em>Camphor Balls</em>, for rubbing on the hands, to prevent chaps, etc.&mdash;Melt three drachms of spermaceti, four drachms of white wax,
and one ounce of almond oil; stir in three drachms of powdered
camphor. Pour the compound into small gallipots, so as to form
small hemispherical cakes. They may be colored with alkanet, if
preferred.</p>

<p><em>Camphorated Oil.</em>&mdash;This is another camphor liniment. The proportions
are the same as in the preceding formula, substituting
olive oil for the alcohol, and exposing the materials to a moderate
heat. As an external stimulant application it is even more powerful
than the spirits; and to obtain its full influence the part treated
should be also covered with flannel and oil silk. It forms a
valuable liniment in chronic rheumatism and other painful affections,
and is specially valuable as a counter-irritant in sore or inflamed
throats and diseased bowels. Camphor constitutes the
basis of a large number of valuable liniments. Thus, in cases of
whooping-cough and some chronic bronchitic affections, the following
liniment may be advantageously rubbed into the chest and
along the spine. Spirits of camphor, two parts; laudanum, half a
part; spirits of turpentine, one part; castile soap in powder, finely
divided, half an ounce; alcohol, 3 parts. Digest the whole together
for three days, and strain through linen. This liniment
should be gently warmed before using. A powerful liniment for
old rheumatic pains, especially when affecting the loins, is the
following: camphorated oil and spirits of turpentine, of each two
parts; water of hartshorn, one part; laudanum, one part; to be
well shaken together. Another very efficient liniment or embrocation,
serviceable in chronic painful affections, may be conveniently
and easily made as follows: Take of camphor, one ounce;
cayenne pepper, in powder, two teaspoonfuls; alcohol, one pint.
The whole to be digested with moderate heat for ten days, and filtered.
It is an active rubificant; and after a slight friction with
it, it produces a grateful, thrilling sensation of heat in the pained
part, which is rapidly relieved.</p>

for the above distressing complaint: Laudanum, two ounces;
spirits of camphor, two ounces; essence of peppermint, two
ounces; Hoffman's anodyne, two ounces; tincture of cayenne pepper,
two drachms; tincture of ginger, one ounce. Mix all together.
Dose, teaspoonful in a little water, or a half teaspoonful repeated
in an hour afterward in a tablespoonful of brandy. This preparation
it is said, will check diarrhea in ten minutes, and abate other
premonitory symptoms of cholera immediately. In cases of
cholera, it has been used with great success to restore reaction by
outward application.</p>

<p><em>Digestive Pills.</em>&mdash;Rhubarb, two ounces; ipecacuanha, half an
ounce; cayenne pepper, quarter of an ounce; soap, half an ounce;
ginger, quarter of an ounce; gamboge, half an ounce. Mix, and
divide into four grain pills.</p>

<p><em>Dried Herbs.</em>&mdash;All herbs which are to be dried should be washed,
separated, and carefully picked over, then spread on a coarse paper
and keep in a room until perfectly dry. Those which are intended
for cooking should be stripped from the stems and rubbed very
fine. Then put them in bottles and cork tightly. Put those
which are intended for medicinal purposes into paper bags, and
keep them in a dry place.</p>

<p><em>Dysentery Specific</em>, (particularly for bloody dysentery in Adults
and Children.)&mdash;Take one pound gum arabic, one ounce gum tragacanth,
dissolved in two quarts of soft water, and strained. Then
take one pound of cloves, half a pound of cinnamon, half a pound
allspice, and boil in two quarts of soft water, and strain. Add it
to the gums, and boil all together over a moderate fire, and stir into
it two pounds of loaf sugar. Strain the whole again when you
take it off, and when it is cool, add to it half a pint sweet tincture
rhubarb, and a pint and a half of best brandy. Cork it tight in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
bottles, as the gums will sour, if exposed. If corked properly it
will keep for years.</p>

drachms; Armenian bole, three drachms; alum, ten grains; oil of
aniseseed, five drops.</p>

<p><em>Infant's Syrup.</em>&mdash;The syrup is made thus: one pound best box
raisins, half an ounce of aniseseed, two sticks licorice; split the
raisins, pound the aniseseed, and cut the licorice fine; add to it
three quarts of rain water, and boil down to two quarts. Feed
three or four times a day, as much as the child will willingly
drink. The raisins are to strengthen, the anise is to expel the
wind, and the licorice as a physic.</p>

<p><em>Basilicon Ointment.</em>&mdash;Good resin, five parts; lard, eight parts;
yellow wax, two parts. Melt, and stir together till cool.</p>

<p><em>Tonic.</em>&mdash;The following is the tonic used by reformed drunkards
to restore the vigor of the stomach. Take of gentian root, half an
ounce; valerian root, one drachm; best rhubarb root, two drachms;
bitter orange peel, three drachms; cardamom seeds, half an ounce;
and cinnamon bark, one drachm. Having bruised all the above
together in a mortar (the druggist will do it if requested), pour
upon it one and a half pints of boiling water and cover up close;
let it stand till cold; strain, bottle, and cork securely; keep in a
dark place. Two tablespoonfuls may be taken every hour before
meals, and half that quantity whenever the patient feels that distressing
sickness and prostration so generally present for some
time after alcoholic stimulants have been abandoned.</p>

<p><em>Whooping Cough.</em>&mdash;Mix a quarter of a pound of ground elecampane
root in half a pint of strained honey and half a pint of water.
Put them in a glazed earthen pot, and place it in a stone oven,
with half the heat required to bake bread. Let it bake until about
the consistency of strained honey, and take it out. Administer in
doses of a teaspoonful before each meal, to a child; if an adult,
double the dose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>

<h2><a name="MANUFACTURERS_DEPARTMENT" id="MANUFACTURERS_DEPARTMENT">MANUFACTURERS' DEPARTMENT.</a></h2>

<p><em>Indelible Ink for Marking Clothing.</em>&mdash;Nitrate of silver, five scruples;
gum arabic, two drachms; sap green, one scruple; distilled water,
one ounce; mix together. Before writing on the article to be
marked, apply a little of the following: carbonate of soda, one-half
ounce; distilled water, four ounces; let this last, which is
the mordant, get dry; then, with a quill pen, write what you
require.</p>

<p><em>Imitation Gold.</em>&mdash;16 parts platina; 7 parts copper; 1 part zinc.
Put in a covered crucible, with powdered charcoal, and melt together
till the whole forms one mass, and are thoroughly incorporated
together. Or, take 4 oz. platina, 3 oz. silver, 1 oz. copper.</p>

<p><em>Imitation Silver.</em>&mdash;11 oz. refined nickel; 2 oz. metalic bismuth.
Melt the compositions together three times, and pour them out in
ley. The third time, when melting, add 2 oz. pure silver. Or take
&frac14; oz. copper, 1 oz. bismuth, 2 oz. saltpetre, 2 oz. common salt, 1
oz. arsenic, 1 oz. potash, 2 oz. brass, and 3 oz. pure silver. Melt
all together in a crucible.</p>

<p><em>Recipe for Making Artificial Honey.</em>&mdash;To 10 lbs. sugar add 3 lbs.
water, 40 grains cream tartar, 10 drops essence peppermint, and
3 lbs. strained honey. First dissolve the sugar in water, and take
off the scum; then dissolve the cream of tartar in a little warm
water, which you will add with some little stirring; then add the
honey; heat to a boiling point, and stir for a few minutes.</p>

<p><em>Vinegar.</em>&mdash;Take forty gallons of soft water, six quarts of cheap
molasses, and six pounds of acetic acid; put them into a barrel
(an old vinegar barrel is best), and let them stand from three to
ten weeks, stirring occasionally. Add a little "mother" of old
vinegar if convenient. Age improves it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>

<em>Soft Soap.</em>&mdash;Dissolve fifteen pounds of common cheap hard soap
in fifteen gallons of hot water, and let it cool. Then dissolve
fifteen pounds of sal soda in fifteen gallons of hot water; add six
pounds of unslaked lime, and boil twenty minutes. Let it cool
and settle, and then pour off the clear liquor very carefully and
mix it with the soap solution. It improves it very much to add
one quart of alcohol after mixing the two solutions. Smaller
quantities can be made in the same proportions. If too strong,
add water to suit.</p>

<p><em>Babbit's Premium Soap.</em>&mdash;5 gals, strong ley; 5 gals water; 5 lbs.
tallow; 1 lb. potash; 2 lbs. sal soda; &frac12; lb. rosin; 1 pt. salt; 1 pt.
washing fluid. Let the water boil; then put in the articles, and
boil half an hour. Stir it well while boiling, and then run into
moulds. It will be ready for use as soon as cold. The above
preparations are for 100 pounds of soap.</p>

<p><em>Celebrated Recipe for Silver Wash.</em>&mdash;One ounce of nitric acid, one
ten-cent piece, and one ounce of quick-silver. Put in an open
glass vessel and let it stand until dissolved; then add one pint of
water, and it is ready for use. Make it into a powder by adding
whiting, and it may be used on brass, copper, German silver, etc.</p>

<p><em>Cement for Aquaria.</em>&mdash;Many persons have attempted to make
aquarium, but have failed on account of the extreme difficulty in
making the tank resist the action of water for any length of time.
Below is a recipe for a cement that can be relied upon; it is perfectly
free from anything that injures the animals or plants; it
sticks to glass, metal, wood, stone, etc., and hardens under water.
A hundred different experiments with cements have been tried,
but there is nothing like it. It is the same as that used in constructing
the tanks of the Zoological Gardens, London, and is almost
unknown in this country. One part, by measure, say a gill,
of litharge; one gill of plaster of Paris; one gill of dry, white
sand, one-third of a gill of finely-powdered resin. Sift and keep
corked tight until required for use, when it is to be made into a
putty by mixing in boiled oil (linseed) with a little patent dryer
added. Never use it after it has been mixed (that is, with the oil)
over fifteen hours. This cement can be used for marine as well
as fresh water aquaria, as it resists the action of salt water. The
tank can be used immediately, but it is best to give it three or
four hours to dry.</p>

<p><em>Cement for Attaching Metal to Glass.</em>&mdash;Take two ounces of a thick
solution of glue, and mix it with one ounce of linseed-oil varnish,
and half an ounce of pure turpentine; the whole are then boiled
together in a close vessel. The two bodies should be clamped
and held together for about two days after they are united,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
to allow the cement to become dry. The clamps may then be
removed.</p>

<p><em>Cement for Mending Broken China.</em>&mdash;Stir plaster of Paris into a
thick solution of gum arabic, till it becomes a viscous paste.
Apply it with a brush to the fractured edges, and draw the parts
closely together.</p>

<p><em>Cement for Mending Steam Boilers.</em>&mdash;Mix two parts of finely powdered
litharge with one part of very fine sand, and one part of
quicklime which has been allowed to slack spontaneously by exposure
to the air. This mixture may be kept for any length of
time without injury. In using it a portion is mixed into paste
with linseed oil, or, still better, boiled linseed oil. In this state
it must be quickly applied, as it soon becomes hard.</p>

<p><em>Cheap White House Paint.</em>&mdash;Take skim milk, two quarts, eight
ounces fresh slaked lime, six ounces linseed oil; two ounces white
Burgundy pitch, three pounds Spanish white. Slake the lime in
water, expose it to the air, and mix in about one-quarter of the
milk, the oil, in which the pitch is previously dissolved, to be added,
a little at the time; then the rest of the milk, and afterwards
the Spanish white. This quantity is sufficient for thirty square
yards, two coats, and costs but a few cents. If the other colors
are wanted, use, instead of Spanish white, other coloring matter.</p>

<p><em>Composition for House-Roofs.</em>&mdash;Take one measure of fine sand, two
of sifted wood-ashes, and three of lime, ground up with oil. Mix
thoroughly, and lay on with a painter's brush, first a thin coat and
then a thick one. This composition is not only cheap, but it
strongly resists fire.</p>

<p><em>Diamond Cement.</em>&mdash;Isinglass, one ounce; distilled vinegar, five
and a half ounces; spirits of wine, two ounces; gum ammoniacum,
half an ounce; gum mastic, half an ounce. Mix well.</p>

<p><em>French Polish.</em>&mdash;To one pint of spirits of wine, add a quarter of
an ounce of gum copal, <span class="err" title="original: quarter">a quarter</span> of an ounce of gum arabic, and one
ounce of shellac. Let the gums be well bruised, and sifted through a
piece of muslin. Put the spirits and the gums together in a vessel
that can be closely corked; place them near a warm stove, and frequently
shake them; in two or three days they will be dissolved;
strain the mixture through a piece of muslin, and keep it tightly
corked for use.</p>

<p><em>Furniture Oil for Polishing and Staining Mahogany.</em>&mdash;Take of linseed
oil, one gallon; alkanet root, three ounces; rose pink, one
ounce. Boil them together ten minutes, and strain so that the oil
be quite clear. The furniture should be well rubbed with it every
day until the polish is brought up, which will be more durable
than any other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>

<em>Glue for ready Use.</em>&mdash;To any quantity of glue use common whiskey
instead of water. Put both together in a bottle, cork tight, and
set it away for three or four days, when it will be fit for use without
the application of heat.</p>

<p><em>A Quart of Ink, for a Dime.</em>&mdash;Buy extract of logwood, which may
be had at three cents an ounce, or cheaper by the quantity. Buy
also, for three cents, an ounce of <em>bi-chromate of potash</em>. Do not
make a mistake, and get the simple chromate of potash. The
former is orange red, and the latter clear yellow. Now, take half
an ounce of extract of logwood and ten grains of bi-chromate of
potash, and dissolve them in a quart of hot rain water. When
cold, pour it into a glass bottle, and leave it uncorked for a week
or two. Exposure to the air is indispensable. The ink is then
made, and has cost five to ten minutes' labor, and about three
cents, beside the bottle. The ink is at first an intense steel blue,
but becomes quite black.</p>

<p><em>An Excellent Substitute for Ink.</em>&mdash;Put a couple of iron nails into a
teaspoonful of vinegar. In half an hour pour in a tablespoonful
of strong tea, and then you will have ink enough for a while.</p>

<p><em>Ink, First-Rate Black.</em>&mdash;Take twelve pounds of bruised galls, five
pounds of gum Senegal, five pounds of green sulphate of iron, and
twelve gallons of rain water. Boil the galls with nine gallons of
water for three hours, adding fresh water to replace what is lost
by evaporation. Let the decoction settle, and draw off the clear
liquor; add to it a strained solution of the gum; dissolve also the
sulphate of iron separately, and mix the whole.</p>

<p><em>Ink, Blue.</em>&mdash;Chinese blue, three ounces; oxalic acid, (pure,) three-quarters
of an ounce; gum arabic, powdered, one ounce; distilled
water, six pints. Mix.</p>

<p><em>Ink, Cheap Printing.</em>&mdash;Take equal parts of lampblack and oil;
mix and keep on the fire till reduced to the right consistency.
This is a good ink for common purposes, and is very cheap. We
have used it extensively ourselves.</p>

<p><em>Ink, Copying.</em>&mdash;Dissolve half an ounce of gum and twenty grains
of Spanish licorice in thirteen drachms of water, and add one
drachm of lampblack, previously mixed with a teaspoonful of
sherry.</p>

<p><em>Ink, Indelible.</em>&mdash;To four drachms of lunar caustic, in four ounces
of water, add 60 drops of nutgalls, made strong by being pulverized
and steeped in soft water. The mordant, which is to be applied
to the cloth before writing, is composed of one ounce of
pearlash, dissolved in four ounces of water, with a little gum
arabic dissolved in it. Wet the spot with this; dry and iron the
cloth; then write.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>

<em>Ink, Indelible Marking.</em>&mdash;One and a half drachms of nitrate of silver,
one ounce of distilled water, half an ounce of strong mucilage
of gum arabic, three-quarters of a drachm of liquid ammonia.
Mix the above in a clean glass bottle, cork tightly, and keep in a
dark place till dissolved, and ever afterwards. Directions for use:
Shake the bottle, then dip a clean quill pen in the ink, and write or
draw what you require on the article; immediately hold it close
to the fire (without scorching), or pass a hot iron over it, and it
will become a deep and indelible black, indestructible by either
time or acids of any description.</p>

<p><em>Ink, Indestructible.</em>&mdash;On many occasions it is of importance to employ
an ink indestructible by any process, that will not equally destroy
the material on which it is applied. For black ink, twenty-five
grains of copal, in powder, are to be dissolved in two hundred
grains of oil of lavender, by the assistance of a gentle heat, and are
then to be mixed with two and a half grains of lampblack and half
a grain of indigo. This ink is particularly useful for labelling
phials, &amp;c., containing chemical, substances of a corrosive nature.</p>

<p><em>Ink for Marking Linen with Type.</em>&mdash;Dissolve one part of asphaltum
in four parts of oil of turpentine, and lamp-black or black-lead, in
fine powder, in sufficient quantity to render of proper consistency

<p><em>Ink Powder for Immediate Use.</em>&mdash;Reduce to powder ten ounces of
gall-nuts, three ounces of green copperas, two ounces each of powdered
alum and gum arabic. Put a little of this mixture into
white wine, and it will be fit for immediate use.</p>

<p><em>Ink Stains.</em>&mdash;The moment the ink is spilled, take a little milk,
and saturate the stain, soak it up with a rag, and apply a little
more milk, rubbing it well in. In a few minutes the ink will be
completely removed.</p>

<p><em>Red Ink.</em>&mdash;Take of the raspings of Brazil wood, quarter of a
pound, and infuse them two or three days in colorless <span class="err" title="original: venegar">vinegar</span>.
Boil the infusion one hour and a half over a gentle fire, and afterward
filter it while hot, through paper laid in an earthenware cullender.
Put it again over the fire, and dissolve in it first half an
ounce of gum arabic, and afterward of alum and white sugar each
half an ounce. Care should be taken that the Brazil wood be not
adulterated with the Braziletto or campeachy wood.</p>

<p><em>Transfer Ink.</em>&mdash;Mastic in tears, four ounces; shellac, six oz.;
Venice turpentine, half an ounce; melt together; add wax, half a
pound; tallow, three ounces. When dissolved, further add hard
tallow soap (in shavings), three ounces; and when the whole is
combined, add lampblack, two ounces. Mix well, cool a little,
and then pour it into molds. This ink is rubbed down with a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
water in a cup or saucer, in the same way as water-color cakes.
In winter, the operation should be performed near the fire.</p>

<p><em>Indian Glues.</em>&mdash;Take one pound of the best glue, the stronger the
better, boil it and strain it very clear; boil also four ounces of isinglass;
put the mixture into a double glue pot, add half a pound
of brown sugar, and boil the whole until it gets thick; then pour
it into thin plates or molds, and when cold you may cut and dry
them in small pieces for the pocket. The glue is used by merely
holding it over steam, or wetting it with the mouth. This is a
most useful and convenient article, being much stronger than common
glue. It is sold under the name of Indian glue, but is much
less expensive in making, and is applicable to all kinds of small
fractures, etc.; answers well on the hardest woods, and cements
china, etc., though, of course, it will not resist the action of hot
water. For parchment and paper, in lieu of gum or paste, it will
be found equally convenient.</p>

<p><em>Japanese Cement.</em>&mdash;Intimately mix the best powdered rice with a
little cold water, then gradually add boiling water until a proper
consistence is acquired, being particularly careful to keep it well
stirred all the time; lastly, it must be boiled for one minute in a
clean saucepan or earthern pipkin. This glue is beautifully white
and almost transparent, for which reason it is well adapted for
fancy paper work, which requires a strong and colorless cement.</p>

<p><em>Liquid Blacking.</em>&mdash;Mix a quarter of a pound of ivory-black, six
gills of vinegar, a tablespoonful of sweet oil, and two large spoonfuls
of molasses. Stir the whole well together, and it will then be
fit for use.</p>

<p><em>Liquid Glue.</em>&mdash;Dissolve one part of powdered alum, one hundred
and twenty parts of water; add one hundred and twenty parts of
glue, ten of acetic acid, and forty of alcohol, and digest. Prepared
glue is made by dissolving common glue in warm water, and
then adding acetic acid (strong vinegar) to keep it. Dissolve one
pound of best glue in one and a half pints of water, and add one
pint of vinegar. It is then ready for use.</p>

<p><em>Magic Copying Paper.</em>&mdash;To make black paper, lampblack mixed
with cold lard; red paper, Venetian red mixed with lard; blue
paper, Prussian blue mixed with lard; green paper, Chrome green
mixed with lard. The above ingredients to be mixed to the consistency
of thick paste, and to be applied to the paper with a rag.
Then take a flannel rag, and rub until all color ceases coming off.
Cut your sheets four inches wide and six inches long; put four
sheets together, one of each color, and sell for twenty-five cents
per package. The first cost will not exceed three cents.</p>

<p>Directions for writing with this paper: Lay down your paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
upon which you wish to write; then lay on the copying paper, and
over this lay any scrap of paper you choose; then take any hard
pointed substance and write as you would with a pen.</p>

<p><em>Mahogany Stain.</em>&mdash;Break two ounces of dragon's blood in pieces,
and put them in a quart of rectified spirits of wine; let the bottle
stand in a warm place, and shake it frequently. When dissolved,
it is fit for use, and will render common wood an excellent imitation
of mahogany.</p>

<p><em>Marine Glue.</em>&mdash;Dissolve four parts of India-rubber in thirty-four
parts of coal tar naptha, aiding the solution with heat and agitation.
The solution is then thick as cream, and it should be added
to sixty-four parts of powdered shellac, which must be heated in
the mixture till all is dissolved. While the mixture is hot it is
poured on plates of metal, in sheets like leather. It can be kept
in that state, and when it is required to be used, it is put into a
pot and heated till it is soft, and then applied with a brush to the
surfaces to be joined. Two pieces of wood joined with this cement
can scarcely be sundered.</p>

<p><em>Parchment.</em>&mdash;Paper parchment may be produced by immersing
paper in a concentratic solution of chloride of zinc.</p>

<p><em>Amalgam of Gold.</em>&mdash;Place one part of gold in a small iron saucepan
or ladle, perfectly clean, then add 8 parts of mercury, and apply
a gentle heat, when the gold will dissolve; agitate the mixture
for one minute, and pour it out on a clean plate or stone slab.</p>

<p>For gilding brass, copper etc. The metal to be gilded is first
rubbed over with a solution of nitrate of mercury, and then covered
with a very thin film of the amalgam. On heat being applied
the mercury volatilizes, leaving the gold behind.</p>

<p>A much less proportion of gold is often employed than the
above, where a very thin and cheap gilding is required, as by increasing
the quantity of the mercury, the precious metal may be
extended over a much larger surface. A similar amalgam prepared
with silver is used for silvering.</p>

<p><em>Amalgam for Mirrors.</em>&mdash;Lead and tin, each 1 oz; bismuth, 2 oz;
mercury, 4 oz.; melt as before, and add the mercury. These are
used to silver mirrors, glass globes, etc., by warming the glass,
melting the amalgam, and applying it.</p>

<p><em>Annealing Steel.</em>&mdash;1. For a small quantity. Heat the steel to a
cherry red in a charcoal fire, then bury in sawdust, in an iron box,
covering the sawdust with ashes. Let stay until cold.&mdash;2. For a
larger quantity, and when it is required to be very "soft." Pack
the steel with cast iron (lathe or planer) chips in an iron box, as
follows: Having at least &frac12; or &frac34; inch in depth of chips in the bottom
of the box, put in a layer of steel, then more chips to fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
spaces between the steel, and also the &frac12; or &frac34; inch space between
the sides of box and steel, then more steel; and lastly, at least 1
inch in depth of chips, well rammed down on top of steel. Heat
to and keep at a red heat for from two to four hours. Do not disturb
the box until cold.</p>

<p><em>To make Bell Metal.</em>&mdash;1. Melt together under powdered charcoal,
100 parts of pure copper, with 20 parts of tin, and unite the two
metals by frequently stirring the mass. Product very fine.&mdash;2.
Copper 3 parts; tin 1 part; as above. Some of the finest church
bells in the world have this composition.&mdash;3. Copper 2 parts: tin
1 part; as above.&mdash;4. Copper 72 parts; tin 26&frac12; parts; iron 1&frac12; parts.
The bells of small clocks or pendules are made of this alloy in
Paris.</p>

<p><em>Brass to Make.</em> 1. <em>Fine Brass.</em>&mdash;2 parts of copper to 1 part of zinc.
This is nearly one equivalent each of copper and zinc, if the equivalent
of the former metal be taken at 63-2; or 2 equivalents of copper
to 1 equivalent of zine, if it be taken with Liebig and Berzelius,
at 31-6.</p>

<p>2. Copper 4 parts, zinc 1 part. An excellent and very useful
brass.</p>

<p><em>Cleansing Solution for Brass.</em>&mdash;Put together two ounces sulphuric
acid, an ounce and a half nitric acid, one dram saltpetre and two
ounces rain water. Let stand for a few hours, and apply by passing
the article in and out quickly, and then washing off thoroughly
with clean rain water. Old, discolored brass chains treated in
this way will look equally as well as when new. The usual
method of drying as in sawdust.</p>

<p><em>To Cover Brass with beautiful Luster Colors.</em>&mdash;One ounce of cream of
tartar is dissolved in one quart of hot water, to which is added
half an ounce of tin salt (protochloride of tin) dissolved in four
ounces of cold water. The whole is then heated to boiling, the
clear solution decanted from a trifling precipitate, and poured under
continual stirring into a solution of three ounces hyposulphite
of soda in one-half a pint of water, whereupon it is again heated
to boiling, and filtered from the separated sulphur. This solution
produces on brass the various luster-colors, depending on the
length of time during which the articles are allowed to remain in
it. The colors at first will be light to dark, gold yellow, passing
through all the tints of red to an irridescent brown. A similar
series of colors is produced by sulphide of copper and lead, which,
however, are not remarkable for their stability; whether this defect
will be obviated by the use of the tin solution, experience and
time alone can show.</p>

<p><em>Bronzing Gun-Barrels.</em>&mdash;The so-called butter of zinc used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
bronzing gun-barrels is made by dissolving zinc in hydrochloric
acid till no more free acid is left; which is secured by placing
zinc in the acid until it ceases to be dissolved. The liquid is then
evaporated until a drop taken out and placed on a piece of glass
solidifies in cooling, when it is mixed with 2 parts of olive oil for
every three parts of the liquid. The barrels must be cleansed
and warmed before applying the so-called butter, which put on
with a piece of linen rag.</p>

<p><em>Bronzing Fluid.</em>&mdash;For brown: Iron filings, or scales, 1 lb.; arsenic,
1 oz.; hydrochloric acid, 1 lb.; metallic zinc, 1 oz. The article
to be bronzed is to be dipped in this solution till the desired
effect be produced.</p>

<p><em>Bronze, Green.</em>&mdash;Acetic acid, diluted, 4 lbs; green veriter, 2 oz.;
muriate of ammonia, 1 oz.; common salt, 2 oz.; alum, &frac12; oz.;
French berries, &frac12; lb.; boil them together till the berries have
yielded their color, and strain. Olive bronze, for brass or copper.&mdash;Nitric
acid, 1 oz.; hydrochloric acid, 2 oz.; titanium or palladium,
as much as will dissolve, and add three pints of distilled
water.</p>

<p><em>To Soften Cast-Iron, for Drilling.</em>&mdash;Heat to a cherry red, having it
lie level in the fire, then with a pair of cold tongs put on a piece of
brimstone, a little less in size than you wish the hole to be when
drilled, and it softens entirely through the piece; let it lie in the fire
until a little cool, when it is ready to drill.</p>

<p><em>To Weld Cast-Iron.</em>&mdash;Take of good clear white sand, three parts;
refined solton, one part; fosterine, one part; rock-salt, one part;
mix all together. Take 2 pieces of cast-iron, heat them in a moderate
charcoal-fire, occasionally taking them out while heating,
and dipping them into the composition, until they are of a proper
heat to weld; then at once lay them on the anvil, and gently hammer
them together, and, if done carefully by one who understands
welding iron, you will have them nicely welded together. One
man prefers heating the metal, then cooling it in the water of
common beans, and heat it again for welding.</p>

<p><em>To recut old Files and Rasps.</em>&mdash;Dissolve 4 oz. of saleratus in 1 quart
of water, and boil the files in it for half an hour; then remove,
wash and dry them. Now have ready, in a glass or stoneware
vessel, 1 quart of rain water, into which you have slowly added 4
oz. of best sulphuric acid, and keep the proportions for any
amount used. Immerse the files in this preparation for from six
to twelve hours, according to fineness or coarseness of the files;
then remove, wash them clean, dry quickly, and put a little sweet
oil on them to cover the surface. If the files are coarse, they will
need to remain in about twelve hours, but for fine files six to eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
hours is sufficient. This plan is applicable to blacksmiths', gunsmiths',
tinners', coppersmiths' and machinists' files. Copper and
tin workers will only require a short time to take the articles out
of their files, as the soft metals with which they become filled are
soon dissolved. Blacksmiths' and saw-mill files require full time.
Files may be recut three times by this process. The liquid may
be used at different times if required. Keep away from children,
as it is poisonous.</p>

<p><em>Twist, Browning for Gun-Barrels.</em>&mdash;Take spirits of nitre &frac34; oz.;
tincture of steel, &frac34; oz.: (if the tincture of steel cannot be obtained,
the unmedicated tincture of iron may be used, but it is not so
good) black brimstone, &frac14; oz.; blue vitriol, &frac12; oz.; corrosive sublimate,
&frac14; oz.; nitric acid, 1 dr. or 60 drops; copperas, &frac14; oz.; mix
with 1&frac12; pts. of rain water, keep corked, also, as the other, and the
process of applying is also the same.</p>

<p><em>Gun Metal.</em>&mdash;1. Melt together 112 lbs. of Bristol brass, 14 lbs. of
spelter, and 7 lbs. of block tin.&mdash;2. Melt together 9 parts of copper
and 1 part of tin; the above compounds are those used in the
manufacture of small and great brass guns, swivels, etc.</p>

<p><em>Chinese Method of Mending Holes in Iron.</em>&mdash;The Chinese mend holes
in cast-iron vessels as follows: They melt a small quantity of iron
in a crucible the size of a thimble, and pour the molten metal on a
piece of felt covered with wood-ashes. This is pressed inside the
vessel against the hole, and as it exudes on the other side it is
struck by a small roll of felt covered with ashes. The new iron
then adheres to the old.</p>

<p><em>Common Pewter.</em>&mdash;Melt in a crucible 7 lbs. of tin, and when fused
throw in 1 lb. of lead, 6 oz. of copper and 2 oz. of zinc. This combination
of metal will form an alloy of great durability and tenacity;
also of considerable luster.</p>

<p><em>Best Pewter.</em>&mdash;The best sort of pewter consists of 100 parts of tin,
and 17 of regulus of antimony.</p>

<p><em>Hard Pewter.</em>&mdash;Melt together 12 lbs. of tin, 1 lb. of regulus of antimony,
and 4 oz. of copper.</p>

<p><em>To Mend Broken Saws.</em>&mdash;Pure silver, 19 parts: pure copper, 1
part: pure brass, 2 parts; all are to be filed into powder and intimately
mixed. Place the saw level upon the anvil, the broken
edges in close contact, and hold them so: now put a small line of
the mixture along the seam, covering it with a large bulk of powdered
charcoal; now with a spirit lamp and a jeweler's blow-pipe,
hold the coal-dust in place, and blow sufficient to melt the solder
mixture: then with a hammer set the joint smooth, if not already
so, and file away any superfluous solder; and you will be surprised
at its strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>

<em>Solder, to Adhere to Brass or Copper.</em>&mdash;Prepare a soldering solution
in this way: Pour a small quantity of muriatic acid on some
zinc filings, so as to completely cover the zinc. Let it stand about
an hour, and then pour off the acid, to which add twice its amount
of water. By first wetting the brass or copper with this preparation,
the solder will readily adhere.</p>

<p><em>Common Solder.</em>&mdash;Put into a crucible 2 lbs. of lead, and when
melted throw in 1 lb. of tin. This alloy is that generally known
by the name of solder. When heated by a hot iron and applied to
tinned iron with powdered rosin, it acts as a cement or solder.</p>

<p><em>Tempering Steel.</em>&mdash;For tempering many kinds of tools, the steel is
first hardened by heating it to a cherry red, and plunging it into
cold water. Afterward the temper is drawn by moderately heating
the steel again. Different degrees of hardness are required
for different purposes, and the degree of heat for each of these,
with the corresponding color, will be found in the annexed table:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very pale straw color, 430°&mdash;the temper required for lancets.</p>

<p>A shade of darker yellow, 450°&mdash;for razors and surgical instruments.</p>

<p>Darker straw-yellow, 470°&mdash;for penknives.</p>

<p>Still darker yellow, 490°&mdash;chisels for cutting iron.</p>

<p>A brown yellow, 500°&mdash;axes and plane-irons.</p>

<p>Yellow, slightly tinged with purple, 520°&mdash;table-knives and
watch-springs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Tempering Liquid.</em>&mdash;1. To 6 quarts of soft water put in corrosive
sublimate, 1 oz.; common salt, 2 handfuls; when dissolved it is
ready for use. The first gives toughness to the steel, while the
latter gives the hardness. Be careful with this preparation, as it
is a dangerous poison.&mdash;2. Salt, &frac12; teacup; saltpetre, &frac12; oz.; alum,
pulverized, 1 tea-spoon; soft water, 1 gallon; never heat over a
cherry red, nor draw any temper.&mdash;3. Saltpetre, sal-ammoniac,
and alum, of each 2 oz.; salt, 1&frac12; lbs.; water, 3 gallons, and draw
no temper.&mdash;4. Saltpetre and alum, each 2 oz.; sal-ammoniac, &frac12;
oz.; salt, 1&frac12; lbs.; soft water, 2 gallons. Heat to a cherry red, and
plunge in, drawing no temper.</p>

<p><em>Bayberry, or Myrtle Soap.</em>&mdash;Dissolve two and a quarter pounds of
white potash in five quarts of water, then mix it with ten pounds
of myrtle wax, or bayberry tallow. Boil the whole over a slow
fire till it turns to soap, then add a teacup of cold water; let it boil
ten minutes longer; at the end of that time turn it into tin molds
or pans, and let them remain a week or ten days to dry; then
turn them out of the molds. If you wish to have the soap scented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
stir into it an essential oil that has an agreeable smell, just before
you turn it into the molds. This kind of soap is excellent for
shaving, and for chapped hands: it is also good for eruptions on
the face. It will be fit for use in the course of three or four weeks
after it is made, but it is better for being kept ten or twelve
months.</p>

<p><em>Chemical Soap</em>, (for taking Oil, Grease, etc., from Cloth).&mdash;Take
five pounds castile soap, cut fine; one pint alcohol; one pint soft
water; two ounces aquafortis; one and a half ounces lampblack;
two ounces of saltpetre; three ounces potash; one ounce of camphor;
and four ounces of cinnamon, in powder. First dissolve
the soap, potash and saltpetre, by boiling; then add all the other
articles, and continue to stir until it cools; then pour into a box
and let it stand twenty-four hours and cut into cakes.</p>

<p><em>Cold Soap.</em>&mdash;Mix twenty-six pounds of melted and strained
grease with four pailfuls of ley, made of twenty pounds of white
potash. Let the whole stand in the sun, stirring it frequently. In
the course of the week, fill the barrel with weak ley.</p>

<p><em>Genuine Erasive Soap.</em>&mdash;Two pounds of good castile soap; half a
pound of carbonate of potash; dissolve in half a pint of hot water.
Cut the soap in thin slices, and boil the soap with the potash until
it is thick enough to mould in cakes; also add alcohol, half an
ounce; camphor, half an ounce; hartshorn, half an ounce; color
with half an ounce of pulverized charcoal.</p>

<p><em>Hard White Soap.</em>&mdash;To fifteen pounds of lard or suet, made boiling
hot, add slowly six gallons of hot ley, or solution of potash,
that will bear up an egg high enough to leave a piece big as a
shilling bare. Take out a little, and cool it. If no grease rise it
is done. If any grease appears, add ley, and boil till no grease
rises. Add three quarts of fine salt, and boil up again. If this
does not harden well on cooling, add more salt. If it is to be perfumed,
melt it next day, add the perfume, and run it in molds or
cut in cakes.</p>

<p><em>Labor-Saving Soap.</em>&mdash;Take two pounds of sal-soda, two pounds of
yellow bar soap, and ten quarts of water. Cut the soap in thin
slices, and boil together for two hours; strain, and it will be fit
for use. Put the clothes in soak the night before you wash, and
to every pail of water in which you boil them, add a pound of
soap. They will need no rubbing; merely rinse them out, and
they will be perfectly clean and white.</p>

<p><em>To Make Good Soap.</em>&mdash;To make matchless soap, take one gallon
of soft soap, to which add a gill of common salt, and boil an hour.
When cold, separate the ley from the crude. Add to the crude two
pounds of sal-soda, and boil in two gallons of soft water till dissolved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
If you wish it better, slice two pounds of common bar
soap and dissolve in the above. If the soft soap makes more than
three pounds of crude, add in proportion to the sal-soda and water.</p>

<p><em>To Make Hard Soap from Soft.</em>&mdash;Take seven pounds of good soft
soap; four pounds sal-soda; two ounces borax; one ounce hartshorn;
half a pound of resin; to be dissolved in twenty-two quarts
of water, and boiled about twenty minutes.</p>

<p><em>Whale Oil Soap</em> (for the destruction of Insects.)&mdash;Render common
ley caustic, by boiling it at full strength on quicklime; then take
the ley and boil it with as much whale oil foot as it will saponify
(change to soap), pour off into molds, and, when cold, it is tolerably
hard. Whale oil foot is the sediment produced in refining
whale oil, and is worth two dollars per barrel.</p>

<p><em>Soluble Glass.</em>&mdash;Mix ten parts of carbonate of potash, fifteen parts
of powdered quartz, and one pound of charcoal. Fuse well together.
The mass is soluble in four or five parts of boiling water,
and the filtered solution, evaporated to dryness, yields a transparent
glass, permanent in the air.</p>

<p><em>To Make Eggs of Pharaoh's Serpents.</em>&mdash;Take mercury and dissolve
it in moderately diluted nitric acid by means of heat, taking care,
however, that there be always an excess of metallic mercury remaining;
decant the solution and pour it into a solution of sulpho-cyanide
of ammonium or potassium, which may be bought at a
good drug store, or of a dealer in chemicals. Equal weights of
both will answer. A precipitate will fall to the bottom of the
beaker or jar, which is to be collected on a filter and washed two
or three times with water, when it is put in a warm place to dry.
Take for every pound of this material one ounce of gum tragacanth
which has been soaked in hot water. When the gum is
completely softened it is to be transferred to a mortar, and the
pulverized and dried precipitate gradually mixed with it by means
of a little water, so as to present a somewhat dry pill mass, from
which by hand pellets of the desired size are formed, put on a
piece of glass, and dried again; they are then ready for use.</p>

<p><em>Tracing Paper.</em>&mdash;In order to prepare a beautiful transparent, colorless
paper, it is best to employ the varnish formed with Demarara
resin in the following way: The sheets intended for this purpose
are laid flat on each other, and the varnish spread over the
uppermost sheet with a brush, until the paper appears perfectly
colorless, without, however, the liquid thereon being visible. The
first sheet is then removed, hung up for drying, and the second
treated in the same manner. After being dried, this paper is capable
of being written on, either with chalk or pencil, or steel
pens. It preserves its colorless transparency without becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
yellow, as is frequently the case with that prepared in any other
way.</p>

<p><em>Unsurpassable Blacking.</em>&mdash;Put one gallon of vinegar into a stone
jug, and one pound of ivory-black well pulverized, half a pound of
loaf sugar, half an ounce of oil of vitriol, and seven ounces of
sweet oil. Incorporate the whole by stirring.</p>

<p>2. Take twelve ounces each of ivory-black and molasses; spermaceti
oil, four ounces; and white wine vinegar, two quarts.
Mix thoroughly. This contains no vitriol, and therefore will not
injure the leather. The trouble of making it is very little, and it
would be well to prepare it for one's self, were it only to be assured
that it is not injurious.</p>

<p><em>Varnish for Iron Work.</em>&mdash;To make a good black varnish for iron
work, take eight pounds of asphaltum and fuse it in an iron kettle;
then add five gallons of boiled linseed oil, one pound of
litharge, half a pound of sulphate of zinc (add these slowly, or it
will fume over), and boil them for about three hours. Now add
one and a half pounds of dark gum amber, and boil for two hours
longer, or until the mass will become quite thick when cool, after
which it should be thinned with turpentine to due consistency.</p>

<p><em>Hair Restorers and Invigorators.</em>&mdash;There are hundreds; Lyon's,
Wood's, Barry's, Bogle's, Jayne's, Storr's, Baker's, Driscol's, Phalon's,
Haskel's, Allen's, Spaulding's, etc. But, though all under
different names, are similar in principle, being vegetable oils dissolved
in alcohol, with the addition of spirit of soap, and an astringent
material, such as tincture of catechu, or infusion of bark.
The best is to dissolve one ounce of castor oil in one quart of 95
alcohol, and add one ounce of tincture of cantharides, two ounces
of tincture of catechu, two ounces of lemon juice, two ounces of
tincture of cinchona; and to scent it, add oil of cinnamon, or oil of
rosemary, or both.</p>

<p><em>To Make the Hair Soft and Glossy.</em>&mdash;Put one ounce of castor oil in
one pint of bay rum or alcohol, and color it with a little of the tincture
of alkanet root. Apply a little every morning.</p>

<p><em>Instantaneous Hair Dye.</em>&mdash;Take one drachm of nitrate of silver,
and add to it just sufficient rain water to dissolve it, <em>and no more</em>;
then take strong spirit of ammonia, and gradually pour on the solution
of silver, until it becomes as clear as water, (<em>the addition of</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>

or three covers of blue paper, to exclude the light&mdash;otherwise it
will spoil. Having made this, obtain two drachms of gallic acid;
put this into another bottle which will contain one-half pint; pour
upon it hot water, and let it stand until cold&mdash;when it is fit for use.</p>

<p><em>Directions to Dye the Hair.</em>&mdash;First wash the head, beard, or moustaches
with soap and water; afterwards with clean water. Dry,
and apply the gallic acid solution, with a clean brush. When it is
almost dry, take a small tooth comb, and with a fine brush, put on
the teeth of the comb a little of the silver solution, and comb it
through the hair, when it will become a brilliant jet black. Wait
a few hours; then wash the head again with clean water. If you
want to make a brown dye, add double or treble the quantity of
water to the silver solution, and you can obtain any shade of color
you choose.</p>

<p><em>To Prevent Gray Hair.</em>&mdash;When the hair begins to change color,
the use of the following pomade has a beneficial effect in preventing
the disease extending, and has the character of even restoring
the color of the hair in many instances: Lard, 4 ounces: spermaceti,
4 drachms: oxide of bismuth, 4 drachms. Melt the lard and
spermaceti together, and when getting cold stir in the bismuth; to
this can be added any kind of perfume, according to choice. It
should be used whenever the hair requires dressing. It must not
be imagined that any good effect speedily results; it is, in general,
a long time taking place, the change being very gradual.</p>

<p><em>Liquid Rouge for the Complexion.</em>&mdash;Four ounces of alcohol, two
ounces of water, twenty grains of carmine; twenty grains of ammonia,
six grains of oxalic acid, six grains of alum&mdash;mix.</p>

drachms; alcohol, six drachms; mix, and then put into one pint of
vinegar, perfumed with lavender; let it stand a fortnight, then
strain for use.</p>

<p><em>Pearl Powder for Complexion.</em>&mdash;Take white bismuth, one pound;
starch powder, one ounce; orris powder, one ounce. Mix and
sift through lawn. Add a drop of otto of roses or neroli.</p>

four ounces; powdered French chalk, two ounces; mix.</p>

alum, one ounce; cream tartar, one ounce; cuttlefish bone, four
ounces: drop lake, two ounces; honey, half a gallon; mix.</p>

<p><em>Spanish Vermilion for the Toilette.</em>&mdash;Take an alkine solution of
bastard saffron, and precipitate the color with lemon juice; mix
the precipitate with a sufficient quantity of finely powdered French
chalk and lemon juice, then add a little perfume.</p>

bark, one ounce; prepared chalk, one ounce; myrrh, one-half
ounce.</p>

<p><em>To Make Brown Teeth White.</em>&mdash;Apply carefully over the teeth, a

lemon, nutmeg and bergamot, each one drachm; oil neroli, three
and a half drachms; seven drops of oils of rosemary, lavender and
cassia; half a pint of spirits of nitre; half a pint of elder-flower
water. Let it stand a day or two, then take a cullender and at the
bottom lay a piece of white cloth, and fill it up, one-fourth of
white sand, and filter through it.</p>

<p><em>Smelling Salts.</em>&mdash;Super carbonate of ammonia, eight parts; put
it in coarse powder into a bottle, and pour out lavender oil one
part.</p>

<p><em>Oil of Roses&mdash;for the Hair.</em>&mdash;Olive oil, two pints: otto of roses,
one drachm; oil of rosemary, one drachm; mix. It may be colored
by steeping a little alkanet root in the oil (by heat) before
scenting it.</p>

<p><em>Arnica Hair Wash.</em>&mdash;When the hair is falling off and becoming
thin, from the too frequent use of castor, Macassar oils, &amp;c., or
when premature baldness arises from illness, the arnica hair wash
will be found of great service in arresting the mischief. It is thus
prepared: take elder water, half a pint; sherry wine, half a pint;
tincture of arnica, half an ounce; alcoholic ammonia, 1 drachm&mdash;if
this last named ingredient is old, and has lost its strength, then
two drachms instead of one may be employed. The whole of
these are to be mixed in a lotion bottle, and applied every night to
the head with a sponge. Wash the head with warm water twice a
week. Soft brushes only must be used during the growth of the
young hair.</p>

<p><em>Ammoniacal Pomatum for Promoting the Growth of Hair.</em>&mdash;Take almond
oil, quarter of a pound; white wax, half an ounce; clarified
lard, three ounces; liquid ammonia, a quarter fluid ounce; otto of

allow the grease to cool till nearly ready to set, then stir in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
ammonia and the perfume, and put into small jars for use. Never
use a hard brush, nor comb the hair too much. Apply the pomade
at night only.</p>

<p><em>Bandoline for the Hair.</em>&mdash;This mixture is best made a little at
a time. Pour a tablespoonful of boiling water on a dozen quince
seeds, and repeat when fresh is required.</p>

<p><em>Artificial Bear's Grease.</em>&mdash;Bear's grease is imitated by a mixture
of prepared veal suet and beef marrow. It may be scented at

with a little water, stir it to a smooth paste; turn it into a bowl;
or any kind of essence; beat it with a silver spoon till well mixed;
thicken it with Indian meal, and keep it in small pots, closely covered;
exposure to the air will harden it.</p>

drachm; sulphate of iron, two drachms; boil for a few minutes,
add common verdigris, one drachm; leave it on the fire two minutes;
withdraw it, and add two drachms of powdered nutgall.
Rub the hair with the liquid, in a few minutes dry it with a warm
cloth, and afterwards wash with water.</p>

<p><em>To Remove Dandruff.</em>&mdash;Take a thimbleful of powdered refined
borax, let it dissolve in a teacupful of water, first brush the head
well, then wet a brush and apply it to the head. Do this every
day for a week, and twice a week for a few times, and you will effectually
remove the dandruff.</p>

<p><em>To Make the Complexion Fair.</em>&mdash;Take emulsion of bitter almonds,
one pint; oxymuriate of quicksilver, two and a half grains; sal
ammonia, one drachm. Use moderately for pimples, freckles,

<h2><a name="HUNTERS_AND_TRAPPERS_SECRETS" id="HUNTERS_AND_TRAPPERS_SECRETS">HUNTERS' AND TRAPPERS' SECRETS.</a></h2>

<p>The following secret applies to <em>all</em> animals, as every animal is
attracted by the peculiar odor in a greater or less degree; but it is
best adapted to land animals, such as Foxes, Minks, Sables, Martins,
Wolves, Bears, Wild Cats, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Take one half pound strained honey, one quarter drachm musk,
three drachms oil of lavender, and four pounds of tallow, mix the
whole thoroughly together, and make it into forty pills, or balls,
and place one of these pills under the pan of each trap when setting
it.</p>

<p>The above preparation will most wonderfully attract all kinds of
animals, and trappers and others who use it will be sure of success.</p>

<p><em>To Catch Foxes.</em>&mdash;Take oil of amber, and beaver's oil, each equal
parts, and rub them over the trap before setting it. Set in the
usual way.</p>

<p><em>To Catch Mink.</em>&mdash;Take oil of amber, and beaver's oil, and rub
over the trap. Bait with fish or birds.</p>

<p><em>To Catch Muskrat.</em>&mdash;In the female muskrat near the vagina is a
small bag which holds from 30 to 40 drops. Now all the trapper
has to do, is to procure a few female muskrats and squeeze the
contents of a bag into a vial. Now, when in quest of muskrats,
sprinkle a few drops of the liquid on the bushes over and around
the trap. This will attract the male muskrats in large numbers,
and if the traps are properly arranged, large numbers of them may
be taken.</p>

<p><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> In trapping Muskrats, steel traps should be used, and they
should be set in the paths and runs of the animal, where they
come upon the banks, and in every case the trap should be set under
the water, and carefully concealed; and care should be taken
that it has sufficient length of chain to enable the animals to reach
the water after being caught, otherwise they are liable to escape
by tearing or gnawing off their legs.</p>

<p><em>To Catch Beaver.</em>&mdash;In trapping for beaver, set the trap at the edge
of the water or dam, at the point where the animals pass from
deep to shoal water, and always beneath the surface, and fasten it
by means of a stout chain to a picket driven in the bank, or to a
bush or tree. A flat stick should be made fast to the trap by a
cord a few feet long, which, if the animal chanced to carry away
the trap, would float on the water and point out its position. The
trap should then be baited with the following preparation, called</p>

<p class="center">
"<em>The Beaver Medicine</em>."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>

This is prepared from a substance called castor, and is obtained
from the glandulous pouches of the <em>male</em> animal.</p>

<p>The contents of five or six of these castor bags are mixed with a
nutmeg, twelve or fifteen cloves and thirty grains of cinnamon in
fine powder, and the whole well stirred together with as much
whiskey as will give it the consistency of mixed mustard. This
preparation must be left closely corked up, and in four or five days
the odor becomes powerful; and this medicine smeared upon the
bits of wood, &amp;c., with which the traps are baited, will attract the
beaver from a great distance, and wishing to make a close inspection,
the animal puts its legs into the trap and is caught.</p>

<p><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> The same caution in regard to length of chain should be observed
for Beaver, as for Otters, Muskrats, &amp;c., for unless they
can reach the water they are liable to get out of the trap and escape.</p>

<p><em>Chinese Art of Catching Fish.</em>&mdash;Take Cocculus Indicus, pulverize
and mix with dough, then scatter it broadcast over the water, as
you would sow seed. The fish will seize it with great avidity, and
will instantly become so intoxicated that they will turn belly up
on top of the water, by dozens, hundreds, or thousands, as the
case may be. All that you now have to do, is to have a boat, or
other convenience to gather them up, and as you gather put them
in a tub of clean water and presently they will be as lively and
healthy as ever.</p>

<p>This means of taking fish, and the manner of doing it, has, heretofore,
been known to but few. The value of such knowledge admits
of no question. This manner of taking fish does not injure
the flesh in the least.</p>

<p><em>Secret Art of Catching fish.</em>&mdash;Put the oil of rhodium on the bait,
when fishing with the hook, and you will always succeed.</p>

<p><em>To Catch Fish.</em>&mdash;Take the juice of smallage or lovage, and mix
with any kind of bait. As long as there remain any kind of fish
within many yards of your hook, you will find yourself busy pulling
them out.</p>

<p><em>To Catch Abundance of Eels, Fish, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Get over the water after
dark, with a light and a dead fish that has been smeared with the
juice of stinking glawdin&mdash;the fish will gather round you in large
quantities, and can easily be scooped up.</p>

<p><em>To Transfer Engravings to Plaster Casts.</em>&mdash;Cover the plate with ink,
polish its surface in the usual way, then put a wall of paper round;
then pour on it some fine paste made with plaster of Paris. Jerk
it to drive out the air bubbles, and let it stand one hour, when you
have a fine impression.</p>

<p><em>The New and Beautiful Art of Transferring on to Glass.</em>&mdash;Colored or
plain Engravings, Photographs, Lithographs, Water Colors, Oil
Colors, Crayons, Steel Plates, Newspaper Cuts, Mezzotinto, Pencil,
Writing, Show Cards, Labels,&mdash;or in fact anything.</p>

<p><em>Directions.</em>&mdash;Take glass that is perfectly clear&mdash;window glass will
answer&mdash;clean it thoroughly; then varnish it, taking care to have
it perfectly smooth; place it where it will be entirely free from
dust; let it stand over night; then take your engraving, lay it in
clear water until it is wet through (say ten or fifteen minutes),
then lay it upon a newspaper, that the moisture may <em>dry from the
surface</em>, and still keep the other side damp. Immediately varnish
your glass the <em>second</em> time, then place your engraving on it, pressing
it down firmly, so as to exclude every particle of air; next rub
the paper from the back, until it is of uniform thickness&mdash;so thin
that you can see through it, then varnish it the <em>third</em> time, and let
it dry.</p>

<p><em>Materials Used for the Above Art.</em>&mdash;Take two ounces balsam of fir,
to one ounce of spirits of turpentine; apply with a camel's hair
brush.</p>

<p><em>To Make Wax Flowers.</em>&mdash;The following articles will be required
to commence wax work: 2 lbs. white wax, &frac14; lb. hair wire, 1 bottle
carmine, 1 ultramarine blue, 1 bottle chrome yellow, 2 bottles
chrome green, No. 1; 2 bottles chrome green, No. 2; 1 bottle rose
pink, 1 bottle royal purple, 1 bottle scarlet powder, 1 bottle balsam
fir, 2 dozen sheets white wax. This will do to begin with. Now
have a clean tin dish and pour therein a quart or two of water;
then put in about 1 lb. of the white wax and let it boil; when cool
enough, so the bubbles will not form on top, it is ready to sheet,
which is done as follows:&mdash;Take half of a window pane, 7×9, and,
after having washed it clean, dip into a dish containing weak soap-suds;
then dip into the wax and draw out steadily and plunge it
into the suds, when the sheet will readily come off. Lay it on a
cloth or clean paper to dry. Proceed in like manner until you
have enough of the white; then add enough of the green powder
to make a bright color, and heat and stir thoroughly until the
color is evenly distributed; then proceed as for sheeting white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
wax. The other colors are rubbed into the leaves after they are
cut out, rubbing light or heavy according to shade.</p>

<p>For patterns you can use any natural leaf, forming the creases
in wax with the thumb nail or a needle; to put the flowers together
or the leaves on to the stem, hold in the hand until warm
enough to stick. If the sheeted wax is to be used in Summer, put
in a little balsam of fir to make it hard. If for Winter, none will
be required.</p>

<p>You can make many flowers without a teacher; but one to assist,
in the commencement, would be a great help; though the
most particular thing about it is to get the wax sheeted. The materials
I have suggested can be procured at any drug store, and
will cost from $3 to $4.50.</p>

<p><em>How to Charm Those Whom You Meet and Love.</em>&mdash;When you desire
to make any one "Love" you with whom you meet, although
not personally acquainted with him, you can very readily reach
him and make his acquaintance, if you observe the foregoing instructions,
in addition to the following directions: Suppose you see
him coming towards you in an unoccupied mood, or is recklessly,
or passively walking past you, all that remains for you to do at
that moment is to concentrate your thought and send it into him as
before explained; and, to your astonishment, if he was passive, he
will look at you, and now is your time to send a thrill to his heart,
by looking him carelessly, though determinately, into his eyes,
and praying with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, that he
may read your thought, and receive your true Love, which God
designs we should bear one another. This accomplished, and you
need not and must not wait for a cold-hearted, fashionable, and
popular Christian introduction; neither should you hastily run into
his arms, but continue operating in this psychological manner;
not losing any convenient opportunity to meet him at an appropriate
place, when an unembarrassed exchange of words will open
the door, to the one so magnetized. At this interview, unless prudence
sanction it, do not shake hands, but let your manners and
loving eyes speak with Christian charity and ease; wherever, or
whenever you meet again, at the first opportunity grasp his hand,
in an earnest, sincere and affectionate manner, observing at the
same time, the following important directions, viz.:&mdash;As you take
his bare hand in yours, press your thumb gently, though firmly,
between the bones of the thumb and forefinger of his hand, and at
the very instant when you press thus on the blood vessels, (which
you can before ascertain to pulsate,) look him earnestly and lovingly,
though not pertly or fiercely, into his eyes, and send all
your heart's, mind's and soul's strength into his organization, and
he will be your friend, and if you find him not to be congenial, you
have him in your power, and by carefully guarding against evil influences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
you can reform him to suit your own purified, Christian,
and loving taste.</p>

<p><em>Mesmerism.</em>&mdash;If you desire to mesmerise a person, who has never
been put into that state, nor in the least affected, the plan is to set
him in an easy posture, and request him to be calm and resigned.
Take him by both hands, or else by one hand and place your other
gently on his forehead. But with whatever part of his body you
choose to come in contact, be sure to always touch two points, answering
to the <em>positive</em> and <em>negative</em> forces. Having taken him by
both hands, fix your eyes upon his, and, if possible, let him contentedly
and steadily look you in the face. Remain in this position
until his eyes close. Then place both your hands on his head,
gently pass them to his shoulders, down the arms, and off at the
ends of his fingers. Throw your hands outward as you return
them to his head, and continue these passes till he can hear no
voice but yours. He is then entirely in the mesmeric state. When
a person is in the mesmeric state, whether put there by yourself or
some one else, you can awake him by the upward passes: or else
do it by an impression, as follows: Tell him, "I will count <em>three</em>,
and at the same instant I say <em>three</em>, I will slap my hands together,
and you will be wide awake and in your perfect senses. Are you
ready?" If he answers in the affirmative, you will proceed to
count "<em>one</em>, <span class="smcap">two</span>, THREE!" The word <em>three</em> should be spoken suddenly,
and in a very loud voice, and at the same instant the palms
of the hands should be smitten together. This will instantly
awake him.</p>

<p><em>To Make Magic Photographs.</em>&mdash;Take, in the first place, an ordinary
print&mdash;a card-picture, for instance&mdash;on albumen paper, beneath
the negative in the usual way, and, when sufficiently printed,
let it be carefully washed in the dark room, so as to remove all
the free nitrate of silver, etc. Now immerse it in the following solution,
also in the dark room: saturated solution bichloride of
mercury (corrosive sublimate), one ounce; hydrochloric acid, one
drachm. The saturated solution is previously prepared by putting
into water more bichloride of mercury than it will dissolve by
shaking in about twelve hours. The print will gradually be
bleached in this liquid, in the ordinary meaning of the word&mdash;that
is, it will disappear; but the fact is, the print is still there&mdash;its
color alone is changed, a double salt having been formed of mercury
and silver, which is white, as many of our readers, who have
been in the habit of intensifying with a mercurial salt, are aware.
As soon as the print has quite disappeared, the paper is thoroughly
washed and dried in the dark room; it is also preserved between
folds of orange-colored paper, in order to keep it from the
action of light, for the surface is still in some measure sensitive to
light. The bleaching of the print&mdash;that is, its conversion into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
white salt&mdash;is effected more quickly by keeping it in motion in the
mercurial solution. As we said before, the print has not been
bleached in reality&mdash;the substance which originally formed it is
still there, together with a new substance, a salt of mercury. But
the two salts of silver and mercury may be easily brought out and
made visible by several solutions, such as sulphide of ammonium,
solution of hydrosulphuric acid; in fact, any of the soluble sulphides,
ammonia and hyposulphite of soda. The latter salt is used
in preference to the others. Small pieces of blotting-paper, therefore,
of the same size as the prints, are cut out and steeped in a
saturated solution of hyposulphite of soda and then dried. The
magic photographs are packed as before stated, between folds of
orange-colored paper; the papers dipped in hyposulphite of soda are
the developers, and may be packed between two sheets of common
writing-paper. The development of the image is effected in the
following manner: place the albumen paper which contains the
whitened print on a pane of glass, print side upward; on this lay
the dry piece of blotting-paper that has been previously dipped
in hyposulphite of soda. Moisten the latter thoroughly, then
place over it a pane of glass, and upon this a weight, to bring the
two pieces of paper into intimate contact. In a very short time
the picture will appear in all its original detail, and of a sepia
tone.</p>

<p><em>Writing on the Arm.</em>&mdash;The conjurer's explanation was a great lesson
in "spiritualism." I next asked him to elucidate the trick of
writing on the arm. On the occasion of my visit to Mr. Forster,
when the raps indicated the second pellet, he required the "spirit"
present to write the initials on his bare arm. Mr. Forster placed
his arm under the table for a moment, then rested it in front of a
lamp burning on the table, and quickly rolled up the sleeve of his
coat. The skin was without stain or mark. He passed his hand
over it once or twice, and the initials of the names I had written
on the second pellet seemed to grow on the arm in letters of crimson.
"It's a trick I do every night. It goes with the audience like
steam," said the conjurer. "Very simple. Well, suppose a name.
What name would you like?" "Henry Clay," I replied. Down went
the conjurer's arm under the table. In a few seconds he raised
it and exposed the bare forearm without mark upon it. He doubled
up his fist tightly so as to bring the muscles of the arm to the
surface, and rubbed the skin smartly with his open hand. The
letters "H. C." soon appeared upon it in well-defined writing of a
deep red color. "There you have it, gentlemen; that's the blood-red
writing. Very simple. All you have to do is take a lucifer
match, and write on your arm with the wrong end of it. If you
moisten the skin with a little salt water first, all the better.
Then wet the palm of the other hand, rub your arm with it. Send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
up the muscles and the blood-red writing will come out. It will
fade away in less than no time. If you look under the table, you
will see that I have a little piece of pointed wood. I can move my
arm under that and write the letters without using the other hand.
But that's a trick which wants practice."</p>

<p><em>Electrical Psychology.</em>&mdash;The most easy and direct mode to produce
electro psychological communication is to take the individual by
the hand, in the same manner as though you were going to shake
hands. Press your thumb on the <em>Ulnar nerve</em>, which spreads its
branches to the ring and little finger, an inch above the knuckle,
and in range of the ring finger. Lay the ball of the thumb flat so
as to cover the minute branches of this nerve of motion and sensation.
When you first take him by the hand, request him to place
his eyes upon yours, and to keep them fixed, so that he may see
every emotion of your mind expressed in the countenance. Continue
this pressure for a half a minute or more. Then request him
to close his eyes, and with your fingers gently brush downward
several times over the eyelids. Throughout the whole process
feel within yourself a fixed determination to close them, so as to
express that determination fully in your countenance and manner.
Then place your hand on the top of his head and press your thumb
firmly on the organ of Individuality, bearing partially downward,
and with the other thumb still pressing the ulnar nerve, tell him&mdash;<em>you
can not open your eyes!</em> Remember, that your manner, your
expression of countenance, your motions, and your language must
all be of the most positive character. If he succeed in opening
his eyes, try it once or twice more, because impressions, whether
physical or mental, continue to deepen by repetition. In case,
however, that you cannot close his eyes, nor see any effect produced
upon them, you should cease making any further efforts, because
you have now fairly tested that his mind and body both
stand in a positive relation as it regards the doctrine of impressions.
If you succeed in closing the subject's eyes by the above
mode, you may then request him to put his hands on his head, or
in any other position you choose, and tell him, <em>you can not stir</em>
them! In case you succeed, request him to be seated, and tell
him, <em>you can not rise!</em> If you are successful in this, request him to
put his hands in motion, and tell him, <em>you can not stop them!</em> If
you succeed, request him to walk the floor, and tell him, <em>you can
not cease walking!</em> And so you may continue to perform experiments
involving muscular motion and paralysis of any kind that
may occur to your mind, till you can completely control him, in
arresting or moving all the voluntary parts of his system.</p>

<p><em>How to Make Persons at a Distance Think of You.</em>&mdash;Let it be particularly
remembered that "Faith" and concentration of thought are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
positively needful to accomplish aught in drawing others to you or
making them think of you. If you have not the capacity or understanding
how to operate an electric telegraph battery, it is no
proof that an expert and competent person should fail doing so;
just so in this case; if faith, meditation, or concentration of
thought fail you, then will you also fail to operate upon others.
First, you must have an yearning for the person you wish to make
think of you; and secondly, you must learn to guess at what time
of day or night he may be unemployed, passive, so that he be in a
proper state to receive the thought which you dispatch to him. If
he should be occupied in any way, so that his nervous forces were
needed to complete his task, his "Human Battery," or thought,
would not be in a recipient or passive condition, therefore your experiment
would fail at that moment. Or if he were under heavy
narcotics, liquors, tobacco, or gluttonous influences, he could not
be reached at such moments. Or, if he were asleep, and you operated
to affect a wakeful mind or thought, you would fail again
at the moment. To make a person at a distance think of you,
whether you are acquainted with him or not, matters not; I again
repeat, find out or guess at what moment he is likely to be passive;
by this I mean easy and careless: then, with the most fervent
prayer, or yearning of your entire heart, mind, soul and
strength, desire he may think of you; and if you wish him to think
on any particular topic in relation to you, it is necessary for you
to press your hands, when operating on him, on such mental faculties
of your head as you wish him to exercise towards you.
This demands a meagre knowledge of Phrenology. His "Feeling
Nature," or "Propensities," you cannot reach through these operations,
but when he once thinks of you, (if he does not know you he
imagines such a being as you are,) he can easily afterwards be
controlled by you, and he will feel disposed to go in the direction
where you are, if circumstances permit, and he is his own master,
for, remember, circumstances alter cases. I said, you cannot
reach his "Feeling," but only his "Thinking Nature," truly, but
after he thinks of you once, his "Feeling Nature," or propensities,
may become aroused through his own organization. In conclusion
on this topic, let me say, that if you wish the person simply
to think of you, one operation may answer; but on the contrary,
if you wish him to meet you, or go where you are, all you
have to do is to persevere in a lawful and Christian manner to operate,
and I assure you, in the course of all natural things, that is,
if no accident or very unfavorable circumstances occur, he will
make his way towards you, and when he comes within sight, or
reaching distance of you, it will be easy to manage him.</p>

<p><em>How to Make Large Noses Small.</em>&mdash;Dr. Cid, an inventive surgeon
of Paris, noticed that elderly people, who for a long time have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
worn eyeglasses supported on the nose by a spring, are apt to have
this organ long and thin. This he attributes to the compression
which the spring exerts on the arteries by which the nose is nourished.
The idea occurred to him that the hint could be made useful.
Not long afterward, a young lady of fifteen years consulted
him, to see if he could restore to moderate dimensions her nose,
which was large, fleshy, and unsightly. The trait, he found, was
hereditary in her family, as her mother and sister were similarly
afflicted. This was discouraging, as hereditary peculiarities are
particularly obstinate. But the doctor determined to try his
method; he took exact measurements, and had constructed for
her a "lunette pince-nez"&mdash;a spring and pad for compressing the
artery&mdash;which she wore at night and whenever she could conveniently
in daytime. In three weeks a consolatory diminution was
evident, and in three months the young lady was quite satisfied
with the improvement in her features.</p>

<p><em>Jockey Tricks.</em>&mdash;<em>How to make a horse appear as though he was badly

<em>To Bore Holes in Glass.</em>&mdash;Any hard steel tool will cut glass with
great facility when kept freely wet with camphor dissolved in turpentine.
A drill-bow may be used, or even the hand alone. A hole
bored may be readily enlarged by a round file. The ragged edges
of glass vessels may also be thus easily smoothed by a flat file.
Flat window glass can readily be sawed by a watch spring saw by
aid of this solution. In short, the most brittle glass can be
wrought almost as easily as brass by the use of cutting tools kept
constantly moist with camphorized oil of turpentine.</p>

<p><em>To Etch upon Glass.</em>&mdash;Procure several thick, clear pieces of crown
glass, and immerse them in melted wax, so that each may receive
a complete coating, or pour over them a solution of wax in benzine.

free from the least particle of wax. When all these drawings are
finished the pieces of glass must be immersed one by one in a
square leaden box or receiver, where they are to be submitted to
the action of hydrofluoric acid gas, made by acting on powdered
fluor-spar by concentrated sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><em>How to get New Varieties of Potatoes.</em>&mdash;When the vines are done
growing and are turned brown; the seed is ripe: then take the
balls and string with a large needle and strong thread; hang them
in a dry place where they will gradually dry and mature, without
danger or injury from frost. In the month of April, soak the ball
for several hours from the pulp; when washed and dried, they
are fit for sowing in rows, in a bed well prepared in the garden;
they will sprout in a fortnight; they must be attended to like
other vegetables. When about two inches high, they may be
thinned and transplanted into rows. As they increase in size, they
should be hilled. In the autumn many of them will be of the
size of a walnut, and from that to a pea. In the following spring
they should be planted in hills, placing the large ones together,&mdash;they
will in the second season attain their full size, and will exhibit
several varieties of form, and may then be selected to suit
the judgment of the cultivator. I would prefer gathering the
balls from potatoes of a good kind. The first crops from seeds
thus obtained will be productive, and will continue so for many
years, gradually deteriorating, until they will need a renewal by
the process.</p>

<em>To Destroy Rats.</em>&mdash;Fill any deep smooth vessel of considerable
capacity to within six inches of the top with water, cover the surface
with bran, and set the vessel in a place most frequented by
these pests. In attempting to get at the bran they will fall in
and be drowned. Several dozen have been taken by this simple
method at a time.</p>

<p><em>To Kill Rats in Barn and Rick.</em>&mdash;Melt hog's lard in a bottle
plunged in water of temperature of 150 degrees Fahrenheit: introduce
into it half an ounce of phosphorus for every pound of lard;
then add a pint of proof spirits or whiskey; cork the bottle firmly
after its contents have been to 150 degrees, taking it out of the
water and agitating till the phosphorus becomes uniformly
diffused, making a milky looking fluid. The spirit may be poured
off on the liquor cooling; and you then have a fatty compound,
which, after being warmed gently, may be incorporated with a
mixture of wheat flour, or sugar, flavored with oil of rhodium, or
oil of anise-seed, etc., and the dough, on being made into pellets,
should be laid at the rat holes; being luminous in the dark, and
agreeable both to the palates and noses, it is readily eaten, and
proves certainly fatal. The rats issue from their holes and seek
for water to quench their burning thirst, and they commonly die
near the water.</p>

<p><em>Rat Poison.</em>&mdash;Flour, six pounds; sugar, one pound; sulphur,
four pounds; phosphorus, four pounds.</p>

<p><em>To Banish and Prevent Mosquitoes from Biting.</em>&mdash;Dilute a little of

<p><em>Ginger Candy.</em>&mdash;Boil a pound of clarified sugar until, upon taking
a drop of it on a piece of stick, it will become brittle when cold.
Mix and stir up with it, for a common article, about a teaspoonful
of ground ginger; if for a superior article, instead of the ground
ginger add half the white of an egg, beaten up previously with
fine sifted loaf sugar, and twenty drops of strong essence of
ginger.</p>

<p><em>Ginger Lozenges.</em>&mdash;Dissolve in one-quarter of a pint of hot water
half an ounce of gum arabic; when cold, stir it up with one and a
half pounds of loaf sugar, and a spoonful of powdered ginger, or
twelve drops of essence of ginger. Roll and beat the whole up
into a paste; make it into a flat cake, and punch out the lozenges
with a round stamp; dry them near the fire, or in an oven.</p>

<p><em>Peppermint Lozenges.</em>&mdash;Best powdered white sugar, seven pounds;
pure starch, one pound; oil of peppermint to flavor. Mix with
mucilage.</p>

<p><em>Peppermint, Rose or Hoarhound Candy.</em>&mdash;They may be made as
lemon candy. Flavor with essence of rose or peppermint or finely
powdered hoarhound. Pour it out in a buttered paper, placed in
a square tin pan.</p>

<p><em>To Clarify Sugar for Candies.</em>&mdash;To every pound of sugar, put a
large cup of water, and put it in a brass or copper kettle, over a
slow fire, for half an hour; pour into it a small quantity of isinglass
and gum Arabic, dissolved together. This will cause all
impurities to rise to the surface; skim it as it rises. Flavor
according to taste.</p>

<p>All kinds of sugar for candy, are boiled as above directed.
When boiling loaf sugar, add a tablespoonful of rum or vinegar,
to prevent its becoming too brittle whilst making.</p>

<p>Loaf sugar when boiled, by pulling and making into small rolls,
and twisting a little, will make what is called little rock, or snow.
By pulling loaf sugar after it is boiled, you can make it as white
as snow.</p>

<p><em>Common Twist Candy.</em>&mdash;Boil three pounds of common sugar and
one pint of water over a slow fire for half an hour, without skimming.
When boiled enough take it off; rub the hands over with
butter; take that which is a little cooled, and pull it as you would
molasses candy, until it is white; then twist or braid it, and cut it
up in strips.</p>

<p><em>Fine Peppermint Lozenges.</em>&mdash;Best powdered white sugar, 7 pounds;
pure starch, 1 pound; oil of peppermint to flavor. Mix with mucilage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>

<em>Everton Taffee.</em>&mdash;To make this favorite and wholesome candy,
take 1&frac12; pounds of moist sugar, 3 ounces of butter, a teacup and a
half of water and one lemon. Boil the sugar, butter, water, and
half the rind of the lemon together, and when done&mdash;which will
be known by dropping into cold water, when it should be quite
crisp&mdash;let it stand aside till the boiling has ceased, and then stir
in the juice of the lemon. Butter a dish, and pour it in about a
quarter of an inch in thickness. The fire must be quick, and the
taffee stirred all the time.</p>

<p><em>Candy Fruit.</em>&mdash;Take 1 pound of the best loaf sugar; dip each
lump into a bowl of water, and put the sugar into your preserving
kettle. Boil it down and skim it until perfectly clear, and in a
candying state. When sufficiently boiled, have ready the fruits
you wish to preserve. Large white grapes, oranges separated into
small pieces, or preserved fruits, taken out of their syrup and
dried, are very nice. Dip the fruits into the prepared sugar while
it is hot; put them in a cold place; they will soon become hard.</p>

<p><em>Popped Corn.</em>&mdash;Dipped in boiling molasses and stuck together
forms an excellent candy.</p>

<p><em>Molasses Candy.</em>&mdash;Boil molasses over a moderately hot fire, stirring
constantly. When you think it is done, drop a little on a
plate, and if sufficiently boiled it will be hard. Add a small quantity
of vinegar to render it brittle and any flavoring ingredient you
prefer. Pour in buttered tin pans. If nuts are to be added strew
them in the pans before pouring out the candy.</p>

<p><em>Liquorice Lozenges.</em>&mdash;Extract of liquorice, 1 pound, powdered
white sugar, 2 pounds. Mix with mucilage made with rosewater.</p>

<p><em>Fig Candy.</em>&mdash;Take 1 pound of sugar and 1 pint of water, set over
a slow fire. When done, add a few drops of vinegar and a lump
of butter, and pour into pans in which split figs are laid.</p>

<p><em>Puds in Candy.</em>&mdash;Can be made in the same manner, substituting
stoned raisins for the figs. Common molasses candy is very nice
with all kinds of nuts added.</p>

<p><em>Scotch Butter Candy.</em>&mdash;Take 1 pound of sugar, 1 pint of water:
dissolve and boil. When done add 1 tablespoonful of butter, and
enough lemon juice and oil of lemon to flavor.</p>

<p><em>Icing for Cakes.</em>&mdash;Beat the whites of two small eggs to a high
froth; then add to them a quarter of a pound of white, ground, or
powdered sugar; beat it well until it will lie in a heap; flavor with
lemon or rose. This will frost the top of a common-sized cake.
Heap what you suppose to be sufficient in the centre of the cake,
then dip a broad-bladed knife in cold water, and spread the ice
evenly over the whole surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>

<em>Saffron Lozenges.</em>&mdash;Finely powdered hay-saffron, 1 ounce; finely
powdered sugar, 1 pound; finely powdered starch, 8 ounces. Mucilage
to mix.</p>

<p><em>Chocolate Cream.</em>&mdash;Chocolate, scraped fine, &frac12; ounce; thick cream,
1 pint; sugar (best), 3 ounces; heat it nearly to boiling, then remove
it from the fire, and mill it well. When cold add the whites
of four or five eggs; whisk rapidly and take up the froth on a
sieve; serve the cream in glasses, and pile up the froth on the top
of them.</p>

<p><em>Candied Lemon or Peppermint for Colds.</em>&mdash;Boil 1&frac12; pounds sugar in
a half pint of water, till it begins to candy around the sides; put
in 8 drops of essence; pour it upon buttered paper, and cut it with
a knife.</p>

<h2><a name="VALUABLE_MISCELLANEOUS_RECEIPTS_FOR_THE_HOUSEHOLD" id="VALUABLE_MISCELLANEOUS_RECEIPTS_FOR_THE_HOUSEHOLD">VALUABLE MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS, FOR THE HOUSEHOLD
AND EVERY DAY REQUIREMENTS.</a></h2>

<p><em>Alum in Starch.</em>&mdash;For starching muslins, ginghams, and calicoes,
dissolve a piece of alum the size of a shellbark, for every pint of
starch, and add to it. By so doing the colors will keep bright for
a long time, which is very desirable when dresses must be often
washed, and the cost is but a trifle.</p>

<p><em>Cider Yeast.</em>&mdash;Take cider from sour apples before it ferments,
scald, skim thoroughly, and pour, while hot, upon flour enough to
make a stiff batter. When cool, add yeast of any kind, and let it
rise, stirring it down as often as it tries to run over for several days,
then put it in a cool place (where it will not freeze), and you will
have something equal to the best hop yeast. It will keep until
May without any further labor.</p>

<p><em>To Destroy Cockroaches.</em>&mdash;The following is said to be effectual:
These vermin are easily destroyed, simply by cutting up green
cucumbers at night, and placing them about where roaches commit
depredations. What is cut from the cucumbers in preparing
them for the table answers the purpose as well, and three applications
will destroy all the roaches in the house. Remove the peelings
in the morning, and renew them at night.</p>

<p><em>Fire Kindlers.</em>&mdash;Take a quart of tar and three pounds of resin,
melt them, bring to a cooling temperature, mix with as much sawdust,
with a little charcoal added, as can be worked in; spread out
while hot upon a board, when cold break up into lumps of the size
of a large hickory nut, and you have, at a small expense, kindling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
material enough for a household for one year. They will easily
ignite from a match and burn with a strong blaze, long enough to
start any wood that is fit to burn.</p>

<p><em>Remedy against Moths.</em>&mdash;An ounce of gum camphor and one of the
powdered shell of red pepper are macerated in eight ounces of
strong alcohol for several days, then strained. With this tincture
the furs or cloths are sprinkled over, and rolled up in sheets. Instead
of the pepper, bitter apple may be used. This remedy is
used in Russia under the name of the Chinese tincture for moths.</p>

<p><em>Substitute for Yeast.</em>&mdash;Boil one pound of flour, one quarter pound
of brown sugar and a little salt in two gallons of water for one
hour. When milk-warm, bottle and cork close, and it will be
ready for use in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><em>To make Ley.</em>&mdash;Have a large tub or cask and bore a hole on one
side for a tap, near the bottom; place several bricks near the hole
and cover them with straw. Fill the barrel with strong wood
ashes. Oak ashes are strongest, and those of appletree wood
make the whitest soap. Pour on boiling water until it begins to
run, then put in the tap and let it soak. If the ashes settle down
as they are wet, fill in until full.</p>

<p><em>Tomato Wine.</em>&mdash;Take ripe, fresh tomatoes, mash very fine, strain
through a fine sieve, sweeten with good sugar, to suit the taste,
set it away in an earthen or glass vessel, nearly full, cover tight,
with exception of a small hole for the refuse to work off through
during its fermentation. When it is done fermenting it will become
pure and clear. Then bottle, and cork tight. A little salt
improves <span class="err" title="original: it">its</span> flavor; age improves it.</p>

<p><em>To Color Brown on Cotton or Woolen.</em>&mdash;For ten pounds of cloth
boil three pounds of catechu in as much water as needed to cover
the goods. When dissolved, add four ounces of blue vitriol; stir
it well; put in the cloth and let it remain all night; in the morning
drain it thoroughly; put four ounces of bi-chromate of potash
in boiling water sufficient to cover your goods; let it remain 15
minutes; wash in cold water; color in iron.</p>

<p><em>To Cleanse and Brighten Faded Brussels Carpet.</em>&mdash;Boil some bran in
water and with this wash the carpet with a flannel and brush, using
fuller's earth for the worst parts. When dry, the carpet must
be well beaten to get out the fuller's earth, then washed over with
a weak solution of alum to brighten the colors. Some housekeepers
cleanse and brighten carpets by sprinkling them first with fine
salt and then sweeping them thoroughly.</p>

<p><em>To give Stoves a Fine, Brilliant Appearance.</em>&mdash;A teaspoonful of pulverized
alum mixed with stove polish will give a stove a fine luster,
which will be quite permanent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>

<em>Method of Keeping Hams in Summer.</em>&mdash;Make bags of unbleached
muslin; place in the bottom a little good sweet hay; put in the
ham, and then press around and over it firmly more hay; tie the
bag and hang up in a dry place. Ham secured in this way will
keep for years.</p>

<p><em>How to Cause Vegetables and Fruits to Grow to an Enormous Size and
also to Increase the Brilliancy and Fragrancy of Flowers.</em>&mdash;A curious
discovery has recently been made public in France, in regard to
the culture of vegetable and fruit trees. By watering with a solution
of sulphate of iron, the most wonderful fecundity has been attained.
Pear-trees and beans, which have been submitted to this
treatment, have nearly doubled in the size of their productions,
and a noticeable improvement has been remarked in their flavor.
Dr. Becourt reports that while at the head of an establishment at
Enghien, or the sulphurous springs, he had the gardens and plantations
connected with it watered, during several weeks of the early
Spring, with sulphurous water, and that not only the plantations
prospered to a remarkable extent, but flowers acquired a peculiar
brilliancy of coloring and healthy aspect which attracted
universal attention.</p>

<p><em>Drying Corn.</em>&mdash;With a sharp knife shave the corn from the ear,
then scrape the cob, leaving one-half the hull clinging to the cob.
Place a tin or earthen vessel two-thirds full of this "milk of corn"
over a kettle of boiling water, stir frequently until dry enough to
spread upon a firm cloth without sticking, when the wind and sun
(away from dust and flies) will soon complete the process. To
prepare for the table, put in cold water, set it where it will become
hot, but not boil, for two hours; then season with salt and pepper,
boil for ten minutes; add of butter and white sugar a tablespoonful
of each just before ready to serve.</p>

<p><em>To Destroy Lice on Chickens.</em>&mdash;The following will kill lice on
the first application: Put six cents worth of cracked <em>Coculus Indicus</em>
berries into a bottle that will hold a half pint of alcohol: fill the
bottle with alcohol, and let it stand twenty-four hours. When the
hen comes off with the young chickens, take the mixture, and with
a small cotton rag, wet the head of each chicken enough to have it
reach through the little feathers to the skin; also, with the same
rag, wet the hen under her wings. Be careful that no child, nor
any one else uses it, because it a <em>deadly poison</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cracked Wheat.</em>&mdash;For a pint of the cracked grain, have two quarts
of water boiling in a smooth iron pot over a quick fire; stir in the
wheat slowly; boil fast and stir constantly for the first half hour
of cooking, or until it begins to thicken and "pop up;" then lift
from the quick fire, and place the pot where the wheat will cook
slowly for an hour longer. Keep it covered closely, stir now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
then, and be careful not to let it burn at the bottom. Wheat
cooked thus is much sweeter and richer than when left to soak
and simmer for hours, as many think necessary. White wheat
cooks the easiest. When ready to dish out, have your moulds
moistened with cold water, cover lightly, and set in a cool place.
Eat warm or cold with milk and sugar.</p>

<p><em>How to Have Green Pea Soup in Winter.</em>&mdash;Sow peas thickly in pots
and boxes, say six weeks before the soup is wanted. Place them
in a temperature of 60° or so, close to the glass in a house or pit.
Cut the plants as soon as they attain a height of from three to six
inches, and rub them through a sieve. The shoots alone will make
a fair soup. Mixed with dry peas, also passed through a sieve, no
one could scarcely distinguish color or flavor from that of real
green pea soup. There is, however, considerable difference in the
flavor of pea leaves, as well as of the peas themselves. The best
marrows, such as Ne Plus Ultra and Veitche's Perfection, yield
the most piquant cuttings. Also the more light the plants receive
the higher the flavor, plants drawn up or at all blanched, being by
no means comparable with those well and strongly grown.</p>

<p>In the spring, a few patches or rows may be sown in open quarters
expressly for green cuttings. These are most perfect and
full flavored when four inches high. When too long, the flavor
seems to have run to wood, and the peculiar aroma of green peas
is weaker.</p>

<p>There is yet another mode of making green pea soup at any season
at very short notice. Chip the peas by steeping them in water
and leaving them in a warm place for a few days. Then slightly
boil or stew, chips and all, and pass them through a sieve. The
flavor is full and good, though such pea soup lacks color. It is
astonishing how much the mere vegetation of seeds develops their
more active and predominant flavor or qualities; a fact that might
often be turned to useful account in the kitchen in the flavoring of
soups or dishes, with turnips, celery, parsley, etc.</p>

<p><em>Composition for Restoring Scorched Linen.</em>&mdash;Boil, to a good consistency,
in half a pint of vinegar, two ounces of fuller's earth, an
ounce of hen's dung, half an ounce of cake soap, and the juice of
two onions. Spread this composition over the whole of the damaged
part; and if the scorching is not quite through, and the
threads actually consumed, after suffering it to dry on, and letting
it receive a subsequent good washing or two, the place will appear
full as white and perfect as any other part of the linen.</p>

<p><em>To Remove Indelible Ink Stains.</em>&mdash;Soak the stained spot in strong
salt water, then wash it with ammonia. Salt changes the nitrate of
silver into chloride of silver, and ammonia dissolves the chloride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>

<em>To Cook Cauliflower.</em>&mdash;Choose those that are close and white and
of middle size, trim off the outside leaves, cut the stalk off flat at
the bottom, let them lie in salt and water an hour before you boil
them. Put them into boiling water with a handful of salt in it,
skim it well and let it boil slowly till done. Fifteen minutes will
suffice for a small one, and twenty will be long enough for a large
one. If it is boiled a minute or two after it is done the flavor will
be impaired.</p>

<p><em>To Pickle String Beans.</em>&mdash;Place them in a pan with alternate layers
of salt and leave them thus for 24 hours. Drain them and
place them in a jar with allspice, cloves, pepper and a little salt.
Boil enough vinegar to cover them, pour over them and let them
stand till the next day, boil the vinegar the second time, and pour
it on again. The next day boil the vinegar for the last time, pour
it over the beans, and when quite cold, cover the jar tightly and
set in a cool closet.</p>

<p><em>How to Cause a Baby to Thrive and Grow.</em>&mdash;Try the milk first drawn
from a cow that is fresh, add one-quarter water, and a little sugar.
If the milk constipates, sweeten it with molasses, or mix with it a
small quantity of magnesia. Abjure soothing syrups, and for colic
give catnip or smellage tea. Give the baby a tepid bath at night
as well as in the morning, rubbing him well with the hand. After
the bath, let him feed and then sleep. We find open air the best
of tonics for babies. <span class="err" title="original: Our's">Ours</span> takes his naps out of doors in the shade
during the warm weather, and his cheeks are two roses.</p>

<p><em>To Can Gooseberries without Breaking them.</em>&mdash;Fill the cans with berries,
and partly cover with water, set the jars into a vessel of water,
and raise the temperature to the boiling point. Boil eight
minutes, remove from the kettle, cover with boiling water, and
seal immediately. If sugar is used, let it be pure white, and
allow eight ounces to a quart of berries. Make into a syrup, and
use in the cans instead of water. The glass cans with glass tops,
a rubber and a screw ring, we have found the simplest and most
perfect of the many kinds offered for sale in the market.</p>

<p><em>Ready Mode of Mending Cracks in Stoves, Pipes and Iron Ovens.</em>&mdash;When
a crack is discovered in a stove, through which the fire or
smoke penetrates, the aperture may be completely closed in a
moment with a composition consisting of wood ashes and common
salt made up into paste with a little water, and plastered over
the crack. The good effect is equally certain, whether the stove,
etc., be cold or hot.</p>

<p><em>To Keep Milk from Turning Sour.</em>&mdash;Add a little sub-carbonate of
soda, or of potash. This by combining with, and neutralizing the
acetic acid formed, has the desired effect, and keeps the milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
from turning sooner than it otherwise would. The addition is
perfectly harmless, and does not injure the taste.</p>

<p><em>Strawberry Vinegar.</em>&mdash;Put four pounds of very ripe strawberries,
nicely dressed, into three quarts of the best vinegar, and let them
stand three or four days; then drain the vinegar through a jelly-bag,
and pour it on the same quantity of fruit. Repeat the process
in three days for a third time. Finally, to each pound of the
liquor thus obtained, add one pound of fine sugar. Bottle, and let
it stand covered, but not tightly corked, one week; then cork
it tight, and set it in a cool, <em>dry</em> place, where it will not freeze.
Raspberry vinegar is made the same way.</p>

<p><em>Cider Vinegar.</em>&mdash;After cider has become too sour for use, set it in
a warm place, put to it occasionally the rinsings of the sugar basin
or molasses jug, and any remains of ale or cold tea; let it remain
with the bung open, and you will soon have the best of vinegar.</p>

<p><em>To Give Luster to Silver.</em>&mdash;Dissolve a quantity of alum in water,
so as to make a pretty strong brine, and skim it carefully; then add
some soap to it, and dip a linen rag in it, and rub over the silver.</p>

<p><em>To Make Water-Proof Porous Cloth.</em>&mdash;Close water-proof cloth fabrics,
such as glazed oil-cloth, India-rubber, and gutta-percha
cloth are completely water-proof, but do not permit perspiration
and the exhaled gases from the skin to pass through them, because
they are air-tight as well as water-tight. Persons who wear
air-tight garments soon become faint, if they are undergoing severe
exercise, such as that to which soldiers are exposed when on
march. A porous, water-proof cloth, therefore, is the best for
outer garments during wet weather, for those whose duties or
labor causes them to perspire freely. The best way for preparing
such cloth is by the following process: Take 2&frac14; pounds of alum
and dissolve this in 10 gallons of boiling water; then in a separate
vessel dissolve the same quantity of sugar of lead in 10 gallons of
water, and mix the two solutions. The cloth is now well handled
in this liquid, until every part of it is penetrated; then it is squeezed
and dried in the air, or in a warm apartment, then washed in cold
water and dried again, when it is fit for use. If necessary, the
cloth may be dipped in the liquid and dried twice before being
washed. The liquor appears curdled, when the alum and lead solutions
are mixed together. This is the result of double decomposition,
the <span class="err" title="original: suphate">sulphate</span> of lead, which is an insoluble salt, being
formed. The sulphate of lead is taken up in the pores of the cloth,
and it is unaffected by rains or moisture, and yet it does not render
the cloth air-tight. Such cloth is also partially non-inflammable.
A solution of alum itself will render cloth, prepared as described,
partially water-proof, but it is not so good as the sulphate
of lead. Such cloth&mdash;cotton or woolen&mdash;sheds rain like the feathers
on the back of a duck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>

<em>To Cleanse Carpet.</em>&mdash;1 teaspoonful liquid ammonia in one gallon
warm water, will often restore the color of carpets, even if produced
by acid or alkali. If a ceiling has been whitewashed with
the carpet down, and a few drops are visible, this will remove it.
Or, after the carpet is well beaten and brushed, scour with ox gall,
which will not only extract grease but freshen the colors&mdash;1 pint
of gall in 3 gallons of warm water, will do a large carpet. Table
floor-cloths may be thus washed. The suds left from a wash
where ammonia is used, even if almost cold, cleanses these floor-cloths
well.</p>

<p><em>To Keep Hams.</em>&mdash;After the meat has been well cured by pickle
and smoke, take some clean ashes from bits of coal; moisten
them with a little water so that they will form a paste, or else just
wet the hams a little, and rub on the dry ashes. Rubbed in thoroughly
they serve as a capital insect protector, and the hams can
be hung up in the smoke-house or wood-chamber without any danger
of molestation.</p>

<p><em>A Cold Cement for Mending Earthenware</em>, says a recent English
work, reckoned a great secret among workmen, is made by grating
a pound of old cheese, with a bread grater, into a quart of
milk, in which it must be left for a period of fourteen hours. It
should be stirred quite often. A pound of unslaked lime, finely
pulverized in a mortar, is then added, and the whole is thoroughly
mixed by beating. This done, the whites of 25 eggs are incorporated
with the rest, and the whole is ready for use. There is another
cement for the same purpose which is used hot. It is made
of resin, beeswax, brick-dust, and chalk boiled together. The
substances to be cemented must be heated, and when the surfaces
are coated with cement, they must be rubbed hard upon each
other, as in making a glue-joint with wood.</p>

<p><em>How to Make Cucumber Vines Bear Five Crops.</em>&mdash;When a cucumber
is taken from the vine let it be cut with a knife, leaving about the
eighth of an inch of the cucumber on the stem, then slit the stem
with a knife from the end to the vine, leaving a small portion of
the cucumber on each division, and on each separate slit there
will be a new cucumber as large as the first.</p>

<p><em>White Cement.</em>&mdash;Take white (fish) glue, 1 lb. 10 oz.; dry white
lead, 6 oz.; soft water, 3 pts.; alcohol, 1 pt.</p>

<p>Dissolve the glue by putting it in a tin kettle or dish, containing
the water, and set this dish in a kettle of water, to prevent the
glue from being burned; when the glue is all dissolved, put in the
lead and stir and boil until it is thoroughly mixed; remove from
the fire, and when cool enough to bottle, add the alcohol, and bottle
while it is yet warm, keeping it corked. This last recipe has
been sold about the country for from twenty-five cents to five dollars,
and one man gave a horse for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>

<em>Bruises on Furniture.</em>&mdash;Wet the part in warm water; double a
piece of brown paper five or six times, soak in the warm water,
and lay it on the place; apply on that a warm, but not hot, flatiron
till the moisture is evaporated. If the bruise be not gone repeat
the process. After two or three applications the dent will be
raised to the surface. If the bruise be small, merely soak it with
warm water, and hold a red-hot iron near the surface, keeping the
surface continually wet&mdash;the bruise will soon disappear.</p>

<p><em>To Prevent Iron Rust.</em>&mdash;Kerosene applied to stoves or farming
implements, during summer, will prevent their rusting.</p>

<p><em>To Color Sheep Skins.</em>&mdash;Unslaked lime and litharge equal parts,
mixed to a thin paste with water, will color buff&mdash;several coats
will make it a dark brown; by adding a little ammonia and nitrate
of silver a fine black is produced. Terra japonica will impart a
"tan color" to wool, and the red shade is deepened by sponging
with a solution of lime and water, using a strong solution of alum
water to "set" the colors; 1 part crystallized nitrate silver, 8
parts carbonate ammonia, and 1&frac12; parts of soft water dyes brown;
every additional coat darkens the color until a black is obtained.</p>

<p><em>Remedy for Bums.</em>&mdash;Take one teacup of lard and the whites of
two eggs; work together as much as it can be, then spread on
cloths and apply. Change as often as necessary.</p>

<p><em>How Summer Suits should be Washed.</em>&mdash;Summer suits are nearly
all made of white or buff linen, pique, cambric, or muslin, and the
art of preserving the new appearance after washing is a matter of
the greatest importance. Common washerwomen spoil everything
with soda, and nothing is more frequent than to see the delicate
tints of lawns and percales turned into dark blotches and muddy
streaks by the ignorance and vandalism of a laundress. It is
worth while for ladies to pay attention to this, and insist upon
having their summer dresses washed according to the directions
which they should be prepared to give their laundresses themselves.
In the first place, the water should be tepid, the soap
should not be allowed to touch the fabric; it should be washed and
rinsed quick, turned upon the wrong side, and hung in the shade
to dry, and when starched (in thin boiled but not boiling starch)
should be folded in sheets or towels, and ironed upon the wrong
side as soon as possible. But linen should be washed in water in
which hay or a quart bag of bran has been boiled. This last will
be found to answer for starch as well, and is excellent for print
dresses of all kinds, but a handful of salt is very useful also to set
the colors of light cambrics and dotted lawns; and a little ox gall
will not only set but brighten yellow and purple tints, and has a
good effect upon green.</p>

<p><em>How to Fasten Rubber to Wood and Metal.</em>&mdash;As rubber plates and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
rings are now-a-days used almost exclusively for making connections
between steam and other pipes and apparatus, much annoyance
is often experienced by the impossibility or imperfection of
an air-tight connection. This is obviated entirely by employing a
cement which fastens alike well to the rubber and to the metal or
wood. Such cement is prepared by a solution of shellac in ammonia.
This is best made by soaking pulverized gum shellac in
ten times its weight of strong ammonia, when a slimy mass is
obtained, which in three to four weeks will become liquid without
the use of hot water. This softens the rubber, and becomes, after
volatilization of the ammonia, hard and impermeable to gases
and fluids.</p>

<p><em>Renewing Maroon Colors on Wool.</em>&mdash;Wash the goods in very weak
lye; then rinse thoroughly in clear water; thus you have a beautiful,
<em>even</em> color, although your goods may have been much faded
and stained. Though the color thus obtained may not be the exact
shade as when new, it is, however, a very pretty one. The
above will not answer for other than all woolen goods of a maroon
color.</p>

<p><em>To make Waterproof Cloth out of thick Ducking.</em>&mdash;The following
French recipe is given: Take two pounds four ounces of alum, and
dissolve it in ten gallons of water. In like manner dissolve the
same quantity of sugar of lead in a similar quantity of water, and
mix the two together. They form a precipitate of the sulphate of
lead. The clear liquor is now withdrawn, and the cloth immersed
one hour in the solution, when it is taken out and dried in the
shade, washed in clean water and dried again.</p>

<p><em>How to Stop a Pinhole in Lead Pipe.</em>&mdash;Take a ten-penny nail, place
the square end upon the hole, and hit it two or three slight blows
with a hammer, and the orifice is closed as tight as though you
had employed a plumber to do it at a cost of a dollar or more.</p>

<p><em>To Build a Chimney that Will Not Smoke.</em>&mdash;The <em>Scientific American</em>
gives the following hints to those who would "build a chimney
which will not smoke":&mdash;The chief point is to make the throat not
less than four inches broad and twelve long; then the chimney
should be abruptly enlarged to double the size, and so continued
for one foot or more; then it may be gradually tapered off as desired.
But the inside of the chimney, throughout its whole length
to the top, should be plastered very smooth with good mortar,
which will harden with age. The area of a chimney should be at
least half a square foot, and no flues less than sixty square inches.
The best shape for a chimney is circular, or many-sided, as giving
less friction, (brick is the best material, as it is a non-conductor,)
and the higher above the roof the better.</p>

<p><em>To Prevent Turners' Wood Splitting.</em>&mdash;Small pieces of valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
wood, such kinds as are used for turning, etc., are very liable to
split readily&mdash;that is, outward from the centre. To prevent this,
soak the pieces, when first cut, in <em>cold</em> water for 24 hours, then boil
in hot water for two or three hours, and afterward dry slowly and
under cover. This will be found useful in making handsome mantel,
toilet, and other articles from sumac, cherry, and other woods
that never grow very large.</p>

<p><em>To Remove Dry Paint on Windows.</em>&mdash;The most economical way to
remove dry paint from the panes is to make a small swab having a
handle some eight inches long, dip it in a little diluted oxalic
acid, and rub off the paint with a swab.</p>

<p><em>Everlasting Fence Posts.</em>&mdash;I discovered many years ago that wood
could be made to last longer than iron in the ground, but thought
the process so simple and inexpensive that it was not worth while
making any stir about it. I would as soon have poplar, basswood,
or quaking ash as any other kind of timber for fence posts. I
have taken out basswood posts after having been set seven years,
which were as sound when taken out as when they were first put
in the ground. Time and weather seemed to have no effect on
them. The posts can be prepared for less than two cents a piece.
This is the recipe: Take boiled linseed oil and stir in it pulverized
charcoal to the consistency of paint. Put a coat of this over the
timber, and there is not a man that will live to see it rotten.</p>

<p><em>How to Test the Richness of Milk.</em>&mdash;Procure any long glass vessel&mdash;a
cologne bottle or long phial. Take a narrow strip of paper,
just the length from the neck to the bottom of the phial, and mark
it off with one hundred lines at equal distances; or into fifty lines
and count each as two, and paste it upon the phial, so as to divide
its length into a hundred equal parts. Fill it to the highest mark
with milk fresh from the cow, and allow it to stand in a perpendicular
position twenty-four hours. The number of spaces occupied
by the cream will give you its exact percentage in the milk without
any guess work.</p>

<p><em>To Remove Stains.</em>&mdash;The stains of ink on cloth, paper, or wood
may be removed by almost all acids: but those acids are to be preferred
which are least likely to injure the texture of the stained
substance. The muriatic acid, diluted with five or six times its
weight of water, may be applied to the spot, and after a minute or
two may be washed off, repeating the application as often as may
be necessary. But the vegetable acids are attended with less risk,
and are equally effectual. A solution of the oxalic, citric (acid of
lemons), or tartareous acids in water may be applied to the most
delicate fabrics, without any danger of injuring them; and the
same solutions will discharge writing but not printing ink. Hence
they may be employed in cleaning books which have been defaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
by writing on the margin, without impairing the text. Lemon-juice
and the juice of sorrels will also remove ink stains, but not
so easily as the concrete acid of lemons or citric acid.</p>

<p><em>To Prevent Snow-water or Rain from Penetrating the Soles of Shoes
or Boots in Winter.</em>&mdash;This simple and effectual remedy is nothing
more than a little beeswax and mutton suet, warmed in a pipkin
until in a liquid state. Then rub some of it lightly over the edges
of the sole where the stitches are, which will repel the wet, and
not in the least prevent the blacking from having the usual effect.</p>

<p><em>An Easy Method of Preventing Moths in Furs or Woolens.</em>&mdash;Sprinkle
the furs or woolen stuffs, as well as the drawers or boxes in which
they are kept, with spirits of turpentine; the unpleasant scent of
which will speedily evaporate on exposure of the stuffs to the air.
Some persons place sheets of paper, moistened with spirits of turpentine,
over, under, or between pieces of cloth, etc., and find it
a very effectual mode.</p>

<p><em>To make Sea-water fit for Washing Linen at Sea.</em>&mdash;Soda put into sea-water
renders it turbid; the lime and magnesia fall to the bottom.
To make sea-water fit for washing linen at sea, as much soda must
be put in it, as not only to effect a complete precipitation of these
earths, but to render the sea-water sufficiently laxivial or alkaline.
Soda should always be taken to sea for this purpose.</p>

<p><em>To Destroy Insects.</em>&mdash;When bugs have obtained a lodgment in
walls or timber, the surest mode of overcoming the nuisance is to
putty up every hole that is moderately large, and oil-paint the
whole wall or timber. In bed-furniture, a mixture of soft soap,
with snuff or arsenic, is useful to fill up the holes where the bolts
or fastenings are fixed, etc. French polish may be applied to
smoother parts of the wood.</p>

<p><em>Poultice for Burns and Frozen Flesh.</em>&mdash;Indian-meal poultices, covered
with young hyson tea, moistened with hot water, and laid
over burns or frozen parts, as hot as can be borne, will relieve the
pain in five minutes; and blisters, if they have not, will not arise.
One poultice is usually sufficient.</p>

<p><em>Cracked Nipples.</em>&mdash;Glycerine and tannin, equal weights, rubbed
together into an ointment, is very highly recommended, as is also
mutton tallow and glycerine.</p>

<p><em>To take the Impression of any Butterfly in all its Colors.</em>&mdash;Having
taken a butterfly, kill it without spoiling its wings, which contrive
to spread out as regularly as possible in a flying position. Then,
with a small brush or pencil, take a piece of white paper; wash
part of it with gum-water, a little thicker than ordinary, so that it
may easily dry. Afterwards, laying your butterfly on the paper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
cut off the body close to the wings, and, throwing it away, lay the
paper on a smooth board with the fly upwards; and, laying another
paper over that, put the whole preparation into a screw-press,
and screw down very hard, letting it remain under that
pressure for half an hour. Afterwards take off the wings of the
butterfly, and you will find a perfect impression of them, with all
their various colors, marked distinctly, remaining on the paper.
When this is done, draw between the wings of your impression
the body of the butterfly, and color it after the insect itself.</p>

<p><em>To take the Stains of Grease from Woolen or Silk.</em>&mdash;Three ounces of
spirits of wine, three ounces of French chalk powdered, and five
ounces of pipe-clay. Mix the above ingredients, and make them
up in rolls about the length of a finger, and you will find a never-failing
remedy for removing grease from woolen or silken goods.
N. B.&mdash;<span class="err" title="original: it it">It is</span> applied by rubbing on the spot either dry or wet, and
afterwards brushing the place.</p>

<p><em>Easy and Safe Method of Discharging Grease from Woolen Cloths.</em>&mdash;Fuller's
earth or tobacco pipe-clay, being put wet on an oil-spot,
absorbs the oil as the water evaporates, and leaves the vegetable
or animal fibres of the cloth clean on being beaten or brushed out.
When the spot is occasioned by tallow or wax, it is necessary to
heat the part cautiously by an iron or the fire while the cloth is
drying. In some kinds of goods, blotting-paper, bran, or raw
starch, may be used with advantage.</p>

<p><em>To take out Spots of Ink.</em>&mdash;As soon as the accident happens, wet
the place with juice of sorrel or lemon, or with vinegar, and the
best hard white soap.</p>

<p><em>To take Iron-moulds out of Linen.</em>&mdash;Hold the iron-mould on the
cover of a tankard of boiling water, and rub on the spot a little
juice of sorrel and a little salt; and when the cloth has thoroughly
imbibed the juice, wash it in lye.</p>

<p><em>To take out Spots on Silk.</em>&mdash;Rub the spots with spirits of turpentine;
this spirit exhaling, carries off with it the oil that causes
the spot.</p>

<p><em>To take Wax out of Velvet of all Colors except Crimson.</em>&mdash;Take a
crumby wheaten loaf, cut it in two, toast it before the fire, and,
while very hot, apply it to the part spotted with wax. Then apply
another piece of toasted bread hot as before, and continue this
application until the wax is entirely taken out.</p>

<p><em>To Bleach Straw.</em>&mdash;Straw is bleached by the vapors of sulphur, or
a solution of oxalic acid or chloride of lime. It may be dyed
with any liquid color.</p>

<p><em>Windows, to Crystallize.</em>&mdash;Dissolve epsom-salts in hot ale, or solution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
of gum arabic, wash it over the window, and let it dry. If
you wish to remove any, to form a border or centre-piece, do it
with a wet cloth.</p>

<p><em>Wax for Bottling.</em>&mdash;Rosin, 13 parts; wax, 1 part; melt and add
any color. Used to render corks and bungs air-tight by <em>melting the
wax</em> over them.</p>

<p><em>Whitewash.</em>&mdash;Slack half a bushel of lime with boiling water, and
cover the vessel to retain the steam. Strain the liquor, and add
one peck of salt previously dissolved in warm water, 3 lbs. of rice
boiled and ground to a paste, Spanish whiting, 8 oz.; glue, 1 lb.;
mix and add hot water, 5 gallons; let it stand a few days, and
apply hot. It makes a brilliant wash for inside or outside works.</p>

<p><em>To Purify Water for Drinking.</em>&mdash;Filter river-water through a
sponge, more or less compressed, instead of stone or sand, by
which the water is not only rendered more clean, but wholesome;
for sand is insensibly dissolved by the water, so that in four or five
years it will have lost a fifth part of its weight. Powder of charcoal
should be added to the sponge when the water is foul or fetid.
Those who examine the large quantity of terrene matter on the
inside of tea-kettles, will be convinced all water should be boiled
before drunk, if they wish to avoid being afflicted with gravel or
stone, etc.</p>

<p><em>To Purify the Muddy Waters of Rivers or Pits.</em>&mdash;Make a number
of holes in the bottom of a deep tub; lay some clean gravel thereon,
and above this some clean sand; sink this tub in the river or
pit, so that only a few inches of the tub will be above the surface
of the water; the river or pit water will filter through the sand,
and rise clear through it to the level of the water on the outside,
and will be pure and limpid.</p>

<p><em>Method of Making Putrid Water Sweet in a Night's Time.</em>&mdash;Four
large spoonfuls of unslacked lime, put into a puncheon of ninety
gallons of putrid water at sea, will, in one night, make it as clear
and sweet as the best spring-water just drawn; but, unless the
water is afterwards ventilated sufficiently to carbonize the lime,
it will be a lime-water. Three ounces of pure unslacked lime
should saturate 90 gallons of water.</p>

<p><em>To Keep Apples from Freezing.</em>&mdash;Apples form an article of chief
necessity in almost every family; therefore, great care is taken to
protect them from frost; it being well known that they, if left unprotected,
are destroyed by the first frost which occurs. They
may be kept in the attic with impunity throughout the winter, by
simply covering them over with a linen cloth; be sure you have
<em>linen</em>, for woolen or other cloth is of <em>no avail</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>

<em>To Preserve Grapes.</em>&mdash;Take a cask or barrel which will hold water,
and put into it, first a layer of bran, dried in an oven, or of
ashes well dried and sifted; upon this place a layer of grapes well
cleaned, and gathered in the afternoon of a dry day, before they
are perfectly ripe; proceed thus with alternate layers of bran or
ashes and grapes, till the barrel is full, taking care that the grapes
do not touch each other, and to let the last layer be of bran or
ashes; then close the barrel so that the air may not penetrate,
which is an essential point. Grapes thus packed will keep for
nine or even twelve months. To restore them to freshness, cut
the end of the stalk of each bunch of grapes, and put it into red
wine, as you would flowers into water. White grapes should be
put into white wine.</p>

<p><em>To Increase the Laying of Eggs.</em>&mdash;The best method is to mix with
their food, every other day, about a teaspoon of ground cayenne
pepper to each dozen fowl. Whilst upon this subject, it would be
well to say, that if your hens lay soft eggs, or eggs without shells,
you should put plenty of old plaster, egg-shells, or even oyster-shells
broken up, where they can get at it.</p>

<p><em>To Preserve Meats.</em>&mdash;Beef to pickle for long keeping. First, thoroughly
rub salt into it, and let it remain in bulk for twenty-four
hours to draw off the blood. Second, take it up, letting it drain,
and pack as desired. Third, have ready a pickle prepared as follows:
for every 100 pounds of beef use 7 pounds salt; saltpetre
and cayenne pepper each, 1 ounce; molasses, 1 quart; and soft
water, 8 gallons; boil and skim well, and when cold pour over the
beef.</p>

<p>Another method is to use 5 pounds salt, 1 pound brown sugar,
and &frac14; oz. of saltpetre, to each 100 pounds; dissolve the above in
sufficient water to cover the meat, and in two weeks drain all off,
and make more same as first. It will then keep through the season.
To boil for eating, put into boiling water; for soups, into cold water.</p>

<p><em>Flies, to Destroy.</em>&mdash;Boil some quassia-chips in a little water,
sweeten with syrup or molasses, and place it in saucers. It is destructive
to flies, but not to children.</p>

<p><em>Walnuts, to Pickle.</em>&mdash;Take 100 young walnuts, lay them in salt
and water for two or three days, changing the water every day.
(If required to be soon ready for use, pierce each walnut with a
larding pin that the pickle may penetrate). Wipe them with a soft
cloth, and lay them on a folded cloth for some hours. Then put
them in a jar, and pour on them sufficient of the above spiced
vinegar, hot, to cover them. Or they may be allowed to simmer
gently in strong vinegar, then put into a jar with a handful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
mustard-seed, 1 oz. of ginger, &frac14; oz. mace, 1 oz. allspice, 2 heads of
garlic, and 2 split nutmegs; and pour on them sufficient boiling
vinegar to cover them. Some prefer the walnuts to be gently simmered
with the brine, then laid on a cloth for a day or two till
they turn black, put into a jar, and hot spiced vinegar poured on
them.</p>

<p><em>To Pickle Cucumbers and Gherkins.</em>&mdash;Small cucumbers, but not too
young, are wiped clean with a dry cloth, put into a jar, and boiling
vinegar, with a handful of salt, poured on them. Boil up the
vinegar every three days, and pour it on them, till they become
green: then add ginger and pepper, and tie them up close for use,
or cover them with salt and water (as above) in a stone jar; cover
them, and set them on the hearth before the fire for two or three
days, till they turn yellow; then put away the water, and cover
them with hot vinegar, and set them near the fire, and keep them
hot for eight or ten days, till they become green; then pour off the
vinegar, cover them with hot spiced vinegar, and cover them close.</p>

<p><em>Mushroom Ketchup.</em>&mdash;Pickled mushrooms, 4 lbs.: salt, 2 lbs.
Sprinkle it on the mushrooms; and, when they liquefy, remove
the juice; acid pimento, 6 oz.; cloves, 1 oz.; boil gently and strain:
the remaining liquor, if any, may be treated with pepper, mace
and ginger for a second quality.</p>

<p><em>Tomato Ketchup.</em>&mdash;Proceed as for mushroom ketchup, and add a
little Chili pepper vinegar.</p>

<p><em>To Take Fac-Similes of Signatures.</em>&mdash;Write your name on a piece
of paper, and while the ink is wet sprinkle over it some finely-powdered
gum arabic, then make a rim round it, and pour on it some
fusible alloy, in a liquid state. Impressions may be taken from
the plates formed in this way, by means of printing-ink and the
copperplate-press.</p>

<p><em>To Copy Letters without a Press.</em>&mdash;A black copying ink, which flows
easily from the pen, and will enable any one to obtain very sharp
copies without the aid of a press, can be prepared in the following
manner: One ounce of coarsely broken extract of logwood and
two drachms of crystallized carbonate of soda are placed in a
porcelain capsule with eight ounces of distilled water, and heated
until the solution is of a deep red color, and all the extract is dissolved.
The capsule is then taken from the fire. Stir well into
the mixture one ounce of glycerine of specific gravity of 1.25, fifteen
grains of neutral chromate of potash, dissolved in a little water,
and two drachms of finely pulverized gum arabic, which may
be previously dissolved in a little hot water so as to produce a
mucilaginous solution. The ink is now complete and ready for
use. In well closed bottles it may be kept for a long time without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
getting mouldy, and, however old it may be, will allow copies of
writing to be taken without the aid of a press. It does not attack
steel pens. This ink cannot be used with a copying press. Its
impression is taken on thin moistened copying paper, at the back
of which is placed a sheet of writing paper.</p>

<p><em>To Obtain Fresh Blown Flowers in Winter.</em>&mdash;Choose some of the
most perfect buds of the flowers you would preserve, such as are
latest in blowing and ready to open; cut them off with a pair of
scissors, leaving to each, if possible, a piece of stem about three
inches long; cover the end of the stem immediately with sealing
wax, and when the buds are a little shrunk and wrinkled, wrap
each of them up separately in a piece of paper, perfectly clean and
dry, and lock them up in a dry box or drawer; and they will keep
without corrupting. In winter, or at any time when you would
have the flowers blow, take the buds at night and cut off the end
of the stem sealed with wax, and put the buds into water wherein
a little nitre or salt has been diffused, and the next day you will
have the pleasure of seeing the buds open and expanding themselves,
and the flowers display their most lively colors, and
breathe their agreeable odors.</p>

<p><em>Cheap Ice Cream.</em>&mdash;Sweet milk, two quarts. Scald the milk, pour
over four eggs, and stir well. Cool off and add sugar and essence
of lemon or vanilla. Pour into a deep, narrow tin pail. Cover,
and set into a wooden pail. Fill up the space between the two
vessels with pounded ice and salt. In half an hour it will be fit
for use. Keep thus in the ice till wanted to use.</p>

<p><em>To Take Impressions from Coins.</em>&mdash;Make a thick solution of isinglass
in water, and lay it hot on the metal; let it remain for twelve
hours, then remove it, breathe on it and apply gold or silver-leaf
on the wrong side. Any color may be given to the isinglass instead
of gold or silver, by simple mixture.</p>

<p><em>To Print Pictures from the Print Itself.</em>&mdash;The page or print is soaked
in a solution first of potass, and then of tartaric acid. This
produces a perfect diffusion of crystals of bitartrate of potass
through the texture of the unprinted part of the paper. As this
salt resists oil, the ink roller may now be passed over the surface,
without transferring any of its contents, except to the printed
paper.</p>

<p><em>To Preserve Steel Knives from Rust.</em>&mdash;Never wrap them in woolen
cloths. When they are not to be used for some time, have them
made bright and perfectly dry; then take a soft rag, and rub each
blade with dry wood ashes.&mdash;Wrap them closely in thick brown
paper, and lay them in a drawer or dry closet. A set of elegant
knives, used only on great occasions, were kept in this way for
over a hundred years without a spot of rust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>

<em>To Plate and Gild without a Battery.</em>&mdash;A very useful solution of
silver or gold for plating or gilding without the aid of a battery
may be made as follows: Take say, 1 ounce of nitrate of
silver, dissolved in one quart of distilled or rain water. When
thoroughly dissolved, throw in a few crystals of hyposulphite of
soda, which will at first form a brown precipitate, but which eventually
becomes redissolved if sufficient hyposulphite has been employed.
A slight excess of this salt must, however, be added.
The solution thus formed may be used for coating small articles
of steel, brass, or German silver, by simply dipping a sponge in
the solution and rubbing it over the surface of the article to be
coated. I have succeeded in coating steel very satisfactorily by
this means, and have found the silver so firmly attached to the
steel (when the solution has been carefully made) that it has been
removed with considerable difficulty. A solution of gold may be
made in the same way, and applied as described. A concentrated
solution either of gold or silver thus made, may be used for coating
parts of articles which have stripped or blistered, by applying
it with a camel hair pencil to the part, and touching the spot at
the same time with a thin clean strip of zinc.</p>

<p><em>To make a Clock for 25 Cents.</em>&mdash;First you get a sheet of stout millboard,
such as is used by bookbinders. This will cost you from
six to ten cents. Get size twenty-seven by twenty-two inches.
Draw two lines the longest way equally distant from the edge and
each other. This divides it into three parts of the same size.
Now from the top measure off ten inches for the face, and then
with your knife partly cut the board through the rest of the lines
below the face, and bend them back and glue together by putting
a strip of cloth over the edges where they meet. Mark out the
face of your clock, and make a hole for the hands. Go to your
tinman, and he will make you a funnel-shaped spout, which you
must glue on the bottom. Then make a spool like a cone&mdash;running
to a point on one end&mdash;and eight inches across on the other.
Wind a string on this cone, commencing at the large end, and
winding down just as you would a top. Tie to the end a conical
ink bottle filled with sand. Make some wooden hands, and put
them on the face. Then fill your box, now made, with sand, and
when it is hung up the sand will run out slowly at the bottom, and
as the sand goes out the weights lower, and turn the wheel, which
makes the hands go around. It will depend upon the size of the
hole at the bottom as to how fast it runs. You can paint it, and
make it quite an ornament and curiosity in your house.</p>
